> How can the number of strongly connected components of a graph change if a new edge is added?

It can either stay the same or decrease. To see that it is possible to stay the same, just suppose you add some edge to a cycle. To see that it is possible to decrease, suppose that your original graph is on three vertices, and is just a path passing through all of them, and the edge added completes this path to a cycle. To see that it cannot increase, notice that adding an edge cannot remove any path that existed before.

So, if $u$ and $v$ are in the same connected component in the original graph, then there are a path from one to the other, in both directions. Adding an edge wont disturb these two paths, so we know that $u$ and $v$ will still be in the same $\text{SCC}$ in the graph after adding the edge. Since no components can be split apart, this means that the number of them cannot increase since they form a partition of the set of vertices.

> Show how the procedure $\text{STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS}$ works on the graph of Figure 22.6. Specifically, show the finishing times computed in line 1 and the forest produced in line 3. Assume that the loop of lines 5â€“7 of $\text{DFS}$ considers vertices in alphabetical order and that the adjacency lists are in alphabetical order.

The finishing times of each vertex were computed in exercise 22.3-2. The forest consists of 5 trees, each of which is a chain. We'll list the vertices of each tree in order from root to leaf: $r$, $u$, $q - y - t$, $x - z$, and $s - w - v$.

> Professor Bacon claims that the algorithm for strongly connected components would be simpler if it used the original (instead of the transpose) graph in the second depth-first search and scanned the vertices in order of _increasing_ finishing times. Does this simpler algorithm always produce correct results?

Professor Bacon's suggestion doesn't work out. As an example, suppose that our graph is on the three vertices $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and consists of the edges $(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)$. Then, we should end up with $\\{2, 3\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$ as our $\text{SCC}$'s. However, a possible $\text{DFS}$ starting at $2$ could explore $3$ before $1$, this would mean that the finish time of $3$ is lower than of $1$ and $2$. This means that when we first perform the $\text{DFS}$ starting at $3$. However, a $\text{DFS}$ starting at $3$ will be able to reach all other vertices. This means that the algorithm would return that the entire graph is a single $\text{SCC}$, even though this is clearly not the case since there is neither a path from $1$ to $2$ of from $1$ to $3$.

> Prove that for any directed graph $G$, we have $((G^\text T)^{\text{SCC}})^\text T = G^{\text{SCC}}$. That is, the transpose of the component graph of $G^\text T$ is the same as the component graph of $G$.

First observe that $C$ is a strongly connected component of $G$ if and only if it is a strongly connected component of $G^\text T$. Thus the vertex sets of $G^{\text{SCC}}$ and $(G^\text T)^{\text{SCC}}$ are the same, which implies the vertex sets of $((G^\text T)^\text{SCC})^\text T$ and $G^{\text{SCC}}$ are the same. It suffices to show that their edge sets are the same. Suppose $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge in $((G^\text T)^{\text{SCC}})^\text T$. Then $(v_j, v_i)$ is an edge in $(G^\text T)^{\text{SCC}}$. Thus there exist $x \in C_j$ and $y \in C_i$ such that $(x, y)$ is an edge of $G^\text T$, which implies $(y, x)$ is an edge of $G$. Since components are preserved, this means that $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge in $G^{\text{SCC}}$. For the opposite implication we simply note that for any graph $G$ we have $(G^\text T)^{\text T} = G$.
