> Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph in which each vertex $u \in V$ is labeled with a unique integer $L(U)$ from the set $\\{1, 2, \ldots, |V|\\}$. For each vertex $u \in V$, let $R(u) = \\{v \in V: u \leadsto v \\}$ be the set of vertices that are reachable from $u$. Define $\min(u)$ to be the vertex in $R(u)$ whose label is minimum, i.e., $\min(u)$ is the vertex $v$ such that $L(v) = \min \\{L(w): w \in R(u) \\}$. Give an $O(V + E)$-time algorithm that computes $\min(u)$ for all vertices $u \in V$.
