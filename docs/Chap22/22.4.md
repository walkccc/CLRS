## 22.4-1

> Show the ordering of vertices produced by $\text{TOPOLOGICAL-SORT}$ when it is run on the dag of Figure 22.8, under the assumption of Exercise 22.3-2.

Our start and finish times from performing the $\text{DFS}$ are

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{label} & d & f \\\\
\hline
m & 1  & 20 \\\\
q & 2  & 5  \\\\
t & 3  & 4  \\\\
r & 6  & 19 \\\\
u & 7  & 8  \\\\
y & 9  & 18 \\\\
v & 10 & 17 \\\\
w & 11 & 14 \\\\
z & 12 & 13 \\\\
x & 15 & 16 \\\\
n & 21 & 26 \\\\
o & 22 & 25 \\\\
s & 24 & 24 \\\\
p & 27 & 28
\end{array}
$$

And so, by reading off the entries in decreasing order of finish time, we have the sequence $p, n, o, s, m, r, y, v, x, w, z, u, q, t$.

## 22.4-2

> Give a linear-time algorithm that takes as input a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ and two vertices $s$ and $t$, and returns the number of simple paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$. For example, the directed acyclic graph of Figure 22.8 contains exactly four simple paths from vertex $p$ to vertex $v: pov$, $poryv$, $posryv$, and $psryv$. (Your algorithm needs only to count the simple paths, not list them.)

(Omit!)

## 22.4-3

> Give an algorithm that determines whether or not a given undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ contains a cycle. Your algorithm should run in $O(V)$ time, independent of $|E|$.

## 22.4-4

> Prove or disprove: If a directed graph $G$ contains cycles, then $\text{TOPOLOGICAL-SORT}(G)$ produces a vertex ordering that minimizes the number of "bad" edges that are inconsistent with the ordering produced.

This is not true. Consider the graph $G$ consisting of vertices $a, b, c$, and $d$. Let the edges be $(a, b)$, $(b, c)$, $(a, d)$, $(d, c)$, and $(c, a)$. Suppose that we start the $\text{DFS}$ of $\text{TOPOLOGICAL-SORT}$ at vertex $c$. Assuming that $b$ appears before $d$ in the adjacency list of $a$, the order, from latest to earliest, of finish times is $c, a, d, b$.

The "bad" edges in this case are $(b, c)$ and $(d, c)$. However, if we had instead ordered them by $a, b, d, c$ then the only bad edges would be $(c, a)$. Thus $\text{TOPOLOGICAL-SORT}$ doesn't always minimizes the number of "bad" edges

## 22.4-5

> Another way to perform topological sorting on a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ is to repeatedly find a vertex of $\text{in-degree}$ $0$, output it, and remove it and all of its outgoing edges from the graph. Explain how to implement this idea so that it runs in time $O(V + E)$. What happens to this algorithm if $G$ has cycles?
