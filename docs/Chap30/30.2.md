> Suppose that instead of performing an $n$-element $\text{FFT}$ over the field of complex numbers (where $n$ is even), we use the ring $\mathbb Z_m$ of integers modulo $m$, where $m = 2^{tn / 2} + 1$ and $t$ is an arbitrary positive integer. Use $\omega = 2^t$ instead of $\omega_n$ as a principal nth root of unity, modulo $m$. Prove that the $\text{DFT}$ and the inverse $\text{DFT}$ are well defined in this system.

## 30.2-7

> Given a list of values $z_0, z_1, \dots, z_{n - 1}$ (possibly with repetitions), show how to find the coefficients of a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree-bound $n + 1$ that has zeros only at $z_0, z_1, \dots, z_{n - 1}$ (possibly with repetitions). Your procedure should run in time $O(n\lg^2 n)$. ($\textit{Hint:}$ The polynomial $P(x)$ has a zero at $z_j$ if and only if $P(x)$ is a multiple of $(x - z_j)$.)

> The **_chirp transform_** of a vector $a = (a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n - 1})$ is the vector $y = (y_0, y_1, \dots, y_{n - 1})$, where $y_k = \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} a_jz^{kj}$ and $z$ is any complex number. The $\text{DFT}$ is therefore a special case of the chirp transform, obtained by taking $z = \omega_n$. Show how to evaluate the chirp transform in time $O(n\lg n)$ for any complex number $z$.
