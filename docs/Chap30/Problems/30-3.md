> We can generalize the $1$-dimensional discrete Fourier transform defined by equation $\text{(30.8)}$ to $d$ dimensions. The input is a $d$-dimensional array $A = (a_{j_1, j_2, \dots, j_d})$ whose dimensions are $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_d$, where $n_1n_2 \cdots n_d = n$. We define the $d$-dimensional discrete Fourier transform by the equation

> **a.** Show that we can compute a $d$-dimensional $\text{DFT}$ by computing $1$-dimensional $\text{DFT}$s on each dimension in turn. That is, we first compute $n / n_1$ separate $1$-dimensional $\text{DFT}$s along dimension $1$. Then, using the result of the $\text{DFT}$s along dimension $1$ as the input, we compute $n / n_2$ separate $1$-dimensional $\text{DFT}$s along dimension $2$. Using this result as the input, we compute $n / n_3$ separate $1$-dimensional $\text{DFT}$s along dimension $3$, and so on, through dimension $d$.
