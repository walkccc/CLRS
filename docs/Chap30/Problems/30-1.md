> **a.** Show how to multiply two linear polynomials $ax + b$ and $cx + d$ using only three multiplications. ($\textit{Hint:}$ One of the multiplications is $(a + b) \cdot (c + d)$.)
>
> **b.** Give two divide-and-conquer algorithms for multiplying two polynomials of degree-bound $n$ in $\Theta(n^{\lg 3})$ time. The first algorithm should divide the input polynomial coefficients into a high half and a low half, and the second algorithm should divide them according to whether their index is odd or even.
>
> **c.** Show how to multiply two $n$-bit integers in $O(n^{\lg 3})$ steps, where each step operates on at most a constant number of $1$-bit values.
