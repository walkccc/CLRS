> Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. For any $k \ge 1$, define $G^{(k)}$ to be the undirected graph $(V^{(k)}, E^{(k)})$, where $V^{(k)}$ is the set of all ordered $k$-tuples of vertices from $V$ and $E^{(k)}$ is defined so that $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k)$ is adjacent to $(w_1, w_2, \dots, w_k)$ if and only if for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$, either vertex $v_i$ is adjacent to $w_i$ in $G$, or else $v_i = w_i$.
