> Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with distinct edge weights $w(u, v)$ on each edge $(u, v) \in E$. For each vertex $v \in V$, let $\max(v) = \max_{(u, v) \in E} \\{w(u, v)\\}$ be the maximum-weight edge incident on that vertex. Let $S_G = \\{\max(v): v \in V\\}$ be the set of maximum-weight edges incident on each vertex, and let $T_G$ be the maximum-weight spanning tree of $G$, that is, the spanning tree of maximum total weight. For any subset of edges $E' \subseteq E$, define $w(E') = \sum_{(u, v) \in E'} w(u, v)$.
