> Suppose that we wish to maintain the transitive closure of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ as we insert edges into $E$. That is, after each edge has been inserted, we want to update the transitive closure of the edges inserted so far. Assume that the graph $G$ has no edges initially and that we represent the transitive closure as a boolean matrix.
>
> **a.** Show how to update the transitive closure $G^\* = (V, E^\*)$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ in $O(V^2)$ time when a new edge is added to $G$.
>
> **b.** Give an example of a graph $G$ and an edge $e$ such that $\Omega(V^2)$ time is required to update the transitive closure after the insertion of $e$ into $G$, no matter what algorithm is used.
>
> **c.** Describe an efficient algorithm for updating the transitive closure as edges are inserted into the graph. For any sequence of $n$ insertions, your algorithm should run in total time $\sum_{i = 1}^n t_i = O(V^3)$, where $t_i$ is the time to update the transitive closure upon inserting the $i$th edge. Prove that your algorithm attains this time bound.
