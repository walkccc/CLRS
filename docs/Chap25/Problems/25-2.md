> A graph $G = (V, E)$ is **_$\epsilon$-dense_** if $|E| = \Theta(V^{1 + \epsilon})$ for some constant $\epsilon$ in the range $0 < \epsilon \le 1$. By using $d$-ary min-heaps (see Problem 6-2) in shortest-paths algorithms on $\epsilon$-dense graphs, we can match the running times of Fibonacci-heap-based algorithms without using as complicated a data structure.

**a.**

- $\text{INSERT}$: $\Theta(\log_d n) = \Theta(1 / \alpha)$.
- $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$: $\Theta(d\log_d n) = \Theta(n^\alpha / \alpha)$.
- $\text{DECREASE-KEY}$: $\Theta(\log_d n) = \Theta(1 / \alpha)$.

**b.** Dijkstra, $O(d\log_d V \cdot V + \log_d V \cdot E)$, if $d = V^\epsilon$, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
O(d \log_d V \cdot V + \log_d V \cdot E)
& = O(V^\epsilon \cdot V / \epsilon + E / \epsilon) \\\\
& = O((V^{1+\epsilon} + E) / \epsilon) \\\\
& = O((E + E) / \epsilon) \\\\
& = O(E).
\end{aligned}
$$

**c.** Run $|V|$ times Dijkstra, since the algorithm is $O(E)$ based on (b), the total time is $O(VE)$.

**d.** Johnson's reweight is $O(VE)$.
