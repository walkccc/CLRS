> Suppose that we have an array of $n$ data records to sort and that the key of each record has the value $0$ or $1$. An algorithm for sorting such a set of records might possess some subset of the following three desirable characteristics:
>
> 1. The algorithm runs in $O(n)$ time.
> 2. The algorithm is stable.
> 3. The algorithm sorts in place, using no more than a constant amount of storage space in addition to the original array.

> **a.** Give an algorithm that satisfies criteria 1 and 2 above.
>
> **b.** Give an algorithm that satisfies criteria 1 and 3 above.
>
> **c.** Give an algorithm that satisfies criteria 2 and 3 above.

> **d.** Can you use any of your sorting algorithms from parts (a)â€“(c) as the sorting method used in line 2 of $\text{RADIX-SORT}$, so that $\text{RADIX-SORT}$ sorts $n$ records with $b$-bit keys in $O(bn)$ time? Explain how or why not.
>
> **e.** Suppose that the $n$ records have keys in the range from $1$ to $k$. Show how to modify counting sort so that it sorts the records in place in $O(n + k)$ time. You may use $O(k)$ storage outside the input array. Is your algorithm stable? ($\textit{Hint:}$ How would you do it for $k = 3$?)

**a.** Counting-Sort.

**b.** Quicksort-Partition.

**c.** Insertion-Sort.

**d.** (a) Yes. (b) No. (c) No.

**e.** Using $O(k)$ outside the input-arr.

```cpp
COUNTING-SORT(A, k)
    let C[0..k] be a new array
    for i = 0 to k
        C[i] = 0
    for i = 1 to A.length
        C[A[i]] = C[A[i]] + 1    // C[i] now contains the number of elements equal to i
    p = 0
    for i = 0 to k
        for j = 1 to C[i]
            p = p + 1
            A[p] = i
```

Not stable, in place, in $O(n + k)$.
