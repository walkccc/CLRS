> Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

Drive navigation.

## 1.2-2

> Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the same machine. For inputs of size $n$ , insertion sort runs in $8n^2$ steps, while merge sort runs in $64n\lg n$ steps. For which values of $n$ does insertion sort beat merge sort?

$$
\begin{aligned}
8n^2 & <   64n\lg n \\\\
 2^n & <   n^8 \\\\
   n & \le 43.
\end{aligned}
$$

## 1.2-3

> What is the smallest value of $n$ such that an algorithm whose running time is $100n^2$ runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is $2^n$ on the same machine?

$$
\begin{aligned}
100n^2 & <   2^n \\\\
     n & \ge 15.
\end{aligned}
$$
