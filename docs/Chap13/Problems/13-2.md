> The **_join_** operation takes two dynamic sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ and an element $x$ such that for any $x_1 \in S_1$ and $x_2 \in S_2$, we have $x_1.key \le x.key \le x_2.key$. It returns a set $S = S_1 \cup \\{x\\} \cup S_2$. In this problem, we investigate how to implement the join operation on red-black trees.

**a.**

- Initialize: $bh = 0$.
- $\text{RB-INSERT}$: if in the last step the root is red, we increase $bh$ by $1$.
- $\text{RB-DELETE}$: if $x$ is root, we decrease $bh$ by $1$.
- Each node: in the simple path, decrease $bh$ by $1$ each time we find a black node.

**b.** Move to the right child if the node has a right child, otherwise move to the left child. If the node is black, we decease $bh$ by $1$. Repeat the step until $bh = T_2.bh$.

**c.** The time complexity is $O(1)$.

```cpp
RB-JOIN'(T[y], x, T[2])
    z.left = T[y]
    z.right = T[2]
    z.parent = T[y].parent
    z.key = x
    if T[y].parent.left = T[y]
        T[y].parent.left = z
    else T[y].parent.right = z
```

**d.** Red, because if both the colors of the roots of $T_y$ and $T_2$ are black and the color of $x.parent$ is red, then the color of $x$ is black and it'll change both the colors of the roots of $T_y$ and $T_2$ and recursively adjust to ensure that $\text{BLACK-HEIGHT}$ doesn't change.

The time complexity is $O(\lg n)$.

**e.** Same, if $T_1.bh\le T_2.bh$, then we can use the above algorithm symmetrically.

**f.** $O(1) + O(\lg n) = O(\lg n)$.
