**a.** See the algorithm $\text{SUM-ARRAYS}(A, B, C)$. The parallelism is $O(n)$ since it's work is $n\lg n$ and the span is $\lg n$.

**b.** If grainsize is $1$, this means that each call of $\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ just sums a single pair of numbers. This means that since the for loop on line 4 will run $n$ times, both the span and work will be $O(n)$. So, the parallelism is just $O(1)$.

```cpp
SUM-ARRAYS(A, B, C)
    n = floor(A.length / 2)
    if n == 0
        C[1] = A[1] + B[1]
    else
        spawn SUM-ARRAYS(A[1..n], B[1..n], C[1..n])
        SUM-ARRAYS(A[n + 1..A.length], B[n + 1..A..length], C[n + 1..A.length])
```

**c.** Let $g$ be the grainsize. The runtime of the function that spawns all the other functions is $\left\lceil \frac{n}{g} \right\rceil$. The runtime of any particular spawned task is $g$. So, we want to minimize

$$\frac{n}{g} + g.$$
 
To do this we pull out our freshman calculus hat and take a derivative, we have

$$0 = 1 âˆ’ \frac{n}{g^2}.$$

To solve this, we set $g = \sqrt n$. This minimizes the quantity and makes the span $O(n / g + g) = O(\sqrt n)$. Resulting in a parallelism of $O(\sqrt n)$.
