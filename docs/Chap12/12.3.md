> Give a recursive version of the $\text{TREE-INSERT}$ procedure.

```cpp
INSERT(value)
    root = INSERT(value, root)
```

```cpp
TREE-INSERT(value, node)
    if node == NIL
        initialize BSTnode(value)
    else if node.key > value
        node.left = INSERT(value, node.left)
    else
        node.right = INSERT(value, node.right)
    return node
```

> Suppose that we construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is one plus the number of nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree.

Number of nodes examined while searching also includes the node which is searched for, which isn't the case when we inserted it.

## 12.3-3

> We can sort a given set of $n$ numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using $\text{TREE-INSERT}$ repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

Here's the algorithm:

```cpp
TREE-SORT(A)
    let T be an empty binary search tree
    for i = 1 to n
        TREE-INSERT(T, A[i])
    INORDER-TREE-WALK(T.root)
```

- Worst case: $\Theta(n^2)$—occurs when a linear chain of nodes results from the repeated $\text{TREE-INSERT}$ operations.
- Best case: $\Theta(n\lg n)$—occurs when a binary tree of height $\Theta(\lg n)$ results from the repeated $\text{TREE-INSERT}$ operations.

> Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting $x$ and then $y$ from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting $y$ and then $x$? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

If node $z$ has two child, when the node $z$ is deleted we'll copy the satellite data of it's successor which is node $y$ and replace it's satellite data with it's right child's data. Now, if this happens the data structure pointing to $y$ will point to a node with a completely different satellite data.

Update the data structure to point to the new node which contains satellite data of $y$.

## 12.3-5

> Suppose that instead of each node $x$ keeping the attribute $x.p$, pointing to $x$'s parent, it keeps $x.succ$, pointing to $x$'s successor. Give pseudocode for $\text{SEARCH}$, $\text{INSERT}$, and $\text{DELETE}$ on a binary search tree $T$ using this representation. These procedures should operate in time $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree $T$. ($\textit{Hint:}$ You may wish to implement a subroutine that returns the parent of a node.)

In $\text{SEARCH}$ and $\text{INSERT}$, we do not need to know the parent of $x$.

```cpp
PARENT(z)
    if z == NIL
        m = T.root
    else
        m = z.left
    while m != x
        p = m
        m = m.right
    return p
```

```cpp
GET-PARENT(T, x)
    if x.right == NIL
        if x == x.succ.left
            x.p = x.succ
        else
            z = x.succ
            x.p = PARENT(z)
    else
        y = TREE-MAXIMUM(x.right)
        if x == y.succ.left
            x.p = y.succ
        else
            z = y.succ
            x.p = PARENT(z)
```

Therefore we can find $x$'s parent in $O(h)$, $\text{DELETE}$ is $O(h + h) = O(h)$.

## 12.3-6

> When node $z$ in $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ has two children, we could choose node $y$ as its predecessor rather than its successor. What other changes to $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ would be necessary if we did so? Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ be changed to implement such a fair strategy?

Update line 5 so that $y$ is set equal to $\text{TREE-MAXIMUM}(z.left)$.

To implement the fair strategy, we could randomly decide each time $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ is called whether or not to use the predecessor or successor.
