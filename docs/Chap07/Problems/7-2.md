Modify the $\text{PARTITION}$ procedure to produce a procedure $\text{PARTITION}'(A, p, r)$ which permutes the elements of $A[p..r]$ and returns two indices $q$ and $t$ where $p \le q \le t \le r$, such that

Then modify the $\text{QUICKSORT}$ procedure to produce a procedure $\text{QUICKSORT}'(p, r)$ that calls $\text{RANDOMIZED-PARTITION}'$ and recurses only on partitions of elements not know to be equal to each other.
