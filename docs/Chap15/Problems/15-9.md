> A certain string-processing language allows a programmer to break a string into two pieces. Because this operation copies the string, it costs $n$ time units to break a string of $n$ characters into two pieces. Suppose a programmer wants to break a string into many pieces. The order in which the breaks occur can affect the total amount of time used. For example, suppose that the programmer wants to break a $20$-character string after characters $2$, $8$, and $10$ (numbering the characters in ascending order from the left-hand end, starting from $1$). If she programs the breaks to occur in left-to-right order, then the first break costs $20$ time units, the second break costs $18$ time units (breaking the string from characters $3$ to $20$ at character $8$), and the third break costs $12$ time units, totaling $50$ time units. If she programs the breaks to occur in right-to-left order, however, then the first break costs $20$ time units, the second break costs $10$ time units, and the third break costs $8$ time units, totaling $38$ time units. In yet another order, she could break first at $8$ (costing $20$), then break the left piece at $2$ (costing $8$), and finally the right piece at $10$ (costing $12$), for a total cost of $40$.

> Design an algorithm that, given the numbers of characters after which to break, determines a least-cost way to sequence those breaks. More formally, given a string $S$ with $n$ characters and an array $L[1..m]$ containing the break points, com- pute the lowest cost for a sequence of breaks, along with a sequence of breaks that achieves this cost.
