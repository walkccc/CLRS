> Suppose that we are given a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ with real-valued edge weights and two distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ . Describe a dynamic-programming approach for finding a longest weighted simple path from $s$ to $t$ . What does the subproblem graph look like? What is the efficiency of your algorithm?
