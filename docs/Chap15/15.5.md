## 15.5-3

> Suppose that instead of maintaining the table $w[i, j]$, we computed the value of $w(i, j)$ directly from equation $\text{(15.12)}$ in line 9 of $\text{OPTIMAL-BST}$ and used this computed value in line 11. How would this change affect the asymptotic running time of $\text{OPTIMAL-BST}$?

Each of the $\Theta(n^2)$ values of $w[i, j]$ would require computing those two sums, both of which can be of size $O(n)$, so, the asymptotic runtime would increase to $O(n^3)$.

> Knuth [212] has shown that there are always roots of optimal subtrees such that $root[i, j - 1] \le root[i, j] \le root[i + 1, j]$ for all $1 \le i < j \le n$. Use this fact to modify the $\text{OPTIMAL-BST}$ procedure to run in $\Theta(n^2)$ time.

Change the **for** loop of line 10 in $\text{OPTIMAL-BST}$ to

```cpp
    for r = r[i, j - 1] to r[i + 1, j]
```

Knuth's result implies that it is sufficient to only check these values because optimal root found in this range is in fact the optimal root of some binary search tree. The time spent within the **for** loop of line 6 is now $\Theta(n)$. This is because the bounds on $r$ in the new **for** loop of line 10 are nonoverlapping.

To see this, suppose we have fixed $l$ and $i$. On one iteration of the **for** loop of line 6, the upper bound on $r$ is

$$r[i + 1, j] = r[i + 1, i + l - 1].$$

When we increment $i$ by $1$ we increase $j$ by $1$. However, the lower bound on $r$ for the next iteration subtracts this, so the lower bound on the next iteration is

$$r[i + 1, j + 1 - 1] = r[i + 1, j].$$

Thus, the total time spent in the **for** loop of line 6 is $\Theta(n)$. Since we iterate the outer **for** loop of line 5 $n$ times, the total runtime is $\Theta(n^2)$.
