## 15.4-4

> Show how to compute the length of an $\text{LCS}$ using only $2 \cdot \min(m, n)$ entries in the $c$ table plus $O(1)$ additional space. Then show how to do the same thing, but using $\min(m, n)$ entries plus $O(1)$ additional space.

Since we only use the previous row of the $c$ table to compute the current row, we compute as normal, but when we go to compute row $k$, we free row $k - 2$ since we will never need it again to compute the length. To use even less space, observe that to compute $c[i, j]$, all we need are the entries $c[i − 1, j]$, $c[i − 1, j − 1]$, and $c[i, j − 1]$. Thus, we can free up entry-by-entry those from the previous row which we will never need again, reducing the space requirement to $\min(m, n)$. Computing the next entry from the three that it depends on takes $O(1)$ time and space.

> Give an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of a sequence of $n$ numbers.

Given a list of numbers $L$, make a copy of $L$ called $L'$ and then sort $L'$.

```cpp
PRINT-LCS(c, X, Y)
    n = c[X.length, Y.length]
    let s[1..n] be a new array
    i = X.length
    j = Y.length
    while i > 0 and j > 0
        if x[i] == y[j]
            s[n] = x[i]
            n = n - 1
            i = i - 1
            j = j - 1
        else if c[i - 1, j] ≥ c[i, j - 1]
            i = i - 1
        else j = j - 1
    for i = 1 to s.length
        print s[i]
```

```cpp
MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X, Y, c, b)
    m = |X|
    n = |Y|
    if c[m, n] != 0 or m == 0 or n == 0
        return
    if x[m] == y[n]
        b[m, n] = ↖
        c[m, n] = MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X[1..m - 1], Y[1..n - 1], c, b) + 1
    else if MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X[1..m - 1], Y, c, b) ≥ MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X, Y[1..n - 1], c, b)
        b[m, n] = ↑
        c[m, n] = MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X[1..m - 1], Y, c, b)
    else
        b[m, n] = ←
        c[m, n] = MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X, Y[1..n - 1], c, b)
```

```cpp
MEMO-LCS-LENGTH(X, Y)
    let c[1..|X|, 1..|Y|] and b[1..|X|, 1..|Y|] be new tables
    MEMO-LCS-LENGTH-AUX(X, Y, c, b)
    return c and b
```

Then, just run the $\text{LCS}$ algorithm on these two lists. The longest common subsequence must be monotone increasing because it is a subsequence of $L'$ which is sorted. It is also the longest monotone increasing subsequence because being a subsequence of $L'$ only adds the restriction that the subsequence must be monotone increasing. Since $|L| = |L'| = n$, and sorting $L$ can be done in $o(n^2)$ time, the final running time will be $O(|L||L'|) = O(n^2)$.

> Give an $O(n\lg n)$-time algorithm to find the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of a sequence of $n$ numbers. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Observe that the last element of a candidate subsequence of length $i$ is at least as large as the last element of a candidate subsequence of length $i - 1$. Maintain candidate subsequences by linking them through the input sequence.)

The algorithm $\text{LONG-MONOTONIC}(S)$ returns the longest monotonically increasing subsequence of $S$, where $S$ has length $n$.

The algorithm works as follows: a new array B will be created such that $B[i]$ contains the last value of a longest monotonically increasing subsequence of length $i$. A new array $C$ will be such that $C[i]$ contains the monotonically increasing subsequence of length $i$ with smallest last element seen so far.

To analyze the runtime, observe that the entries of $B$ are in sorted order, so we can execute line 9 in $O(\lg n)$ time. Since every other line in the for-loop takes constant time, the total run-time is $O(n\lg n)$.

```cpp
LONG-MONOTONIC(S)
    let B[1..n] be a new array where every value = ∞
    let C[1..n] be a new array
    L = 1
    for i = 1 to n
        if A[i] < B[1]
            B[1] = A[i]
            C[1].head.key = A[i]
        else
            let j be the largest index of B such that B[j] < A[i]
            B[j + 1] = A[i]
            C[j + 1] = C[j]
            INSERT(C[j + 1], A[i])
            if j + 1 > L
                L = L + 1
    print C[L]
```
