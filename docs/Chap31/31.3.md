> Draw the group operation tables for the groups $(\mathbb Z_4, +_4)$ and $(\mathbb Z_5^\*, \cdot_5)$. Show that these groups are isomorphic by exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence $\alpha$ between their elements such that $a + b \equiv c (\mod 4)$ if and only if $\alpha(a) \cdot \alpha(b) \equiv \alpha(c) (\mod 5)$.

- $(\mathbb Z_4, +_4)$: $\\{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \\}$.
- $(\mathbb Z_5^\*, \cdot_5)$: $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \\}$.

$\alpha(x) = 2^{x-1}$.

> Prove Theorem 31.14.

A nonempty closed subset of a finite group is a subgroup.

- Closure: the subset is closed.
- Identity: suppose $a \in S'$, then $a^{(k)} \in S'$. Since the subset is finite, there must be a period such that $a^{(m)} = a^{(n)}$, hence $a^{(m)}a^{(-n)} = a^{(m - n)} = 1$, therefore the subset must contain the identity.
- Associativity: inherit from the origin group.
- Inverses: suppose $a^{(k)} = 1$, the inverse of element $a$ is $a^{(k - 1)}$ since $aa^{(k - 1)} = a^{(k)} = 1$.

$\phi(p^e) = p^e \cdot \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right ) = p^{e - 1}(p - 1)$.

> Show that for any integer $n > 1$ and for any $a \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$, the function $f_a : \mathbb Z_n^\* \rightarrow \mathbb Z_n^\*$ defined by $f_a(x) = ax \mod n$ is a permutation of $\mathbb Z_n^\*$.

To prove it is a permutation, we need to prove that

- for each element $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$, $f_a(x) \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$,
- the numbers generated by $f_a$ are distinct.

Since $a \in \mathbb Z_{n}^\*$ and $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$, then $f_a(x) = ax \mod n \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ by the closure property.

Suppose there are two distinct numbers $x \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ and $y \in \mathbb Z_n^\*$ that $f_a(x) = f_a(y)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
              f_a(x) & = f_a(y) \\\\
           ax \mod n & = ay \mod n \\\\
(a \mod n)(x \mod n) & = (a \mod n)(y \mod n) \\\\
          (x \mod n) & = y \mod n \\\\
                   x & \equiv y \mod n,
\end{aligned}
$$

which contradicts the assumption, therefore the numbers generated by $f_a$ are distinct.
