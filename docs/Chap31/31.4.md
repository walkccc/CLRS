## 31.4-2

> Prove that the equation $ax \equiv ay ~(\text{mod}~n)$ implies $x \equiv y ~(\text{mod}~n)$ whenever $\text{gcd}(a, n) = 1$. Show that the condition $\text{gcd}(a, n) = 1$ is necessary by supplying a counterexample with $\text{gcd}(a, n) > 1$.

$d = \text{gcd}(ax, n) = \text{gcd}(x, n){equation}
Since $ax \cdot x' + n \cdot y' = d$, then $x \cdot (ax') + n \cdot y' = d$.

$x_0 = x'(ay / d)$,

$x_0' = (ax')(y / d) = x'(ay / d) = x_0$.

Assume that $x_0 \ge n / d$, then the largest solution is $x_0 + (d - 1) * (n / d) \ge d * n / d \ge n$, which is impossible, therefore $x_0 < n / d$.

## 31.4-4 $\star$
> Let $p$ be prime and $f(x) \equiv f_0 + f_1 x + \cdots + f_t x^t ~(\text{mod}~p)$ be a polynomial of degree $t$, with coefficients $f_i$ drawn from $\mathbb{Z}_p$. We say that $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ is a __*zero*__ of $f$ if $f(a) \equiv 0 ~(\text{mod}~p)$. Prove that if $a$ is a zero of $f$, then $f(x) \equiv (x - a) g(x)~(\text{mod}~p)$ for some polynomial $g(x)$ of degree $t - 1$. Prove by induction on $t$ that if $p$ is prime, then a polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $t$ can have at most $t$ distinct zeros modulo $p$.
