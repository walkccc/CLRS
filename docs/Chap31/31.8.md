The smallest Carmichael number is $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$; here, $\lambda(n) = \text{lcm}(2, 10, 16) = 80$, which divides $560$. Prove that Carmichael numbers must be both "square-free" (not divisible by the square of any prime) and the product of at least three primes. (For this reason, they are not very common.)

## 31.8-3

> Prove that if $x$ is a nontrivial square root of $1$, modulo $n$, then $\gcd(x - 1, n)$ and $\gcd(x + 1, n)$ are both nontrivial divisors of $n$.

$$
\begin{array}{rlll}
           x^2 & \equiv & 1 & (\mod n), \\\\
       x^2 - 1 & \equiv & 0 & (\mod n), \\\\
(x + 1)(x - 1) & \equiv & 0 & (\mod n).
\end{array}
$$

$n \mid (x + 1)(x - 1)$, suppose $\gcd(x - 1, n) = 1$, then $n \mid (x + 1)$, then $x \equiv -1 (\mod n)$ which is trivial, it contradicts the fact that $x$ is nontrivial, therefore $\gcd(x - 1, n) \ne 1$, $\gcd(x + 1, n) \ne 1$.
