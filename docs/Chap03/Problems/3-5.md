**a.** We have

$$
f(n) =
\begin{cases}
O(g(n)) \text{ and } {\Omega}^{\infty}(g(n)) & \text{if $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$}, \\\\
                                     O(g(n)) & \text{if $0 \le f(n) \le cg(n)$}, \\\\
                     {\Omega}^{\infty}(g(n)) & \text{if $0 \le cg(n) \le f(n)$, for infinitely many integers $n$}.
\end{cases}
$$

If there are only finite $n$ such that $f(n) \ge cg(n) \ge 0$. When $n \to \infty$, $0 \le f(n) \le cg(n)$, i.e., $f(n) = O(g(n))$.

Obviously, it's not hold when we use $\Omega$ in place of ${\Omega}^{\infty}$.

**b.**

- Advantages: We can characterize all the relationships between all functions.
- Disadvantages: We cannot characterize precisely.

**c.** For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have if $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ then $f(n) = O'(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$.

But the conversation is not true.

**d.** We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde\Omega(g(n)) = \\{f(n):
    & \text{ there exist positive constants $c$, $k$, and $n_0$ such that } \\\\
    & \text{ $0 \le cg(n)\lg^k(n) \le f(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$}.\\}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\Theta}(g(n)) = \\{f(n):
  & \text{ there exist positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$, $k_1$, $k_2$, and $n_0$ such that } \\\\
  & \text{ $0\le c_1 g(n) \lg^{k_1}(n) \le f(n)\le c_2g (n) \lg^{k_2}(n)$ for all $n\ge n_0$.}\\}
\end{aligned}
$$

For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \tilde\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = \tilde O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \tilde\Omega(g(n))$.
