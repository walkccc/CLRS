> We can apply the iteration operator $^\*$ used in the $\lg^\*$ function to any monotonically increasing function $f(n)$ over the reals. For a given constant $c \in \mathbb R$, we define the iterated function ${f_c}^\*$ by ${f_c}^\*(n) = \min \\{i \ge 0 : f^{(i)}(n) \le c \\}$ which need not be well defined in all cases. In other words, the quantity ${f_c}^\*(n)$ is the number of iterated applications of the function $f$ required to reduce its argument down to $c$ or less.

For each of the following functions $f(n)$ and constants $c$, give as tight a bound as possible on ${f_c}^\*(n)$.

$$
\begin{array}{ccl}
f(n)      & c & {f_c}^\*                    \\\\
\hline
n - 1     & 0 &  \Theta(n)                  \\\\
\lg n     & 1 &  \Theta(\lg^\*{n})          \\\\
n / 2     & 1 &  \Theta(\lg n)              \\\\
n / 2     & 2 &  \Theta(\lg n)              \\\\
\sqrt 2   & 2 &  \Theta(\lg\lg n)           \\\\
\sqrt 2   & 1 &  \text{does not converge}   \\\\
n^{1 / 2} & 2 &  \Theta(\log_3{\lg n})      \\\\
n / \lg n & 2 &  \omega(\lg\lg n), o(\lg n)
\end{array}
