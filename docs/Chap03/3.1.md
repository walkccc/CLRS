> Let $f(n) + g(n)$ be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of $\Theta$-notation, prove that $\max(f(n), g(n)) = \Theta(f(n) + g(n))$.

First, let's clarify what the function $\max(f(n), g(n))$ is. Let's define the function $h(n) = \max(f(n), g(n))$. Then

$$
h(n) =
\begin{cases}
f(n) & \text{ if } f(n) \ge g(n), \\\\
g(n) & \text{ if } f(n) <   g(n).
\end{cases}
$$

Since $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ are asymptotically nonnegative, there exists $n_0$ such that $f(n) \ge 0$ and $g(n) \ge 0$ for all $n \ge n_0$. Thus for $n \ge n_0$ , $f(n) + g(n) \ge f(n) \ge 0$ and $f(n) + g(n) \ge g(n) \ge 0$. Since for any particular $n$, $h(n)$ is either $f(n)$ or $g(n)$, we have $f(n) + g(n) \ge h(n) \ge 0$, which shows that

$$h(n) = \max(f(n), g(n)) \le c_2(f(n) + g(n))$$

for all $n \ge n_0$ (with $c_2 = 1$ in the definition of $\Theta$).

Similarly, since for any particular $n$, $h(n)$ is the larger of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have for all $n \ge n_0$, $0 \le f(n) \le h(n)$ and $0 \le g(n) \le h(n)$. Adding these two inequalities yields $0 \le f(n) + g(n) \le 2h(n)$, or equivalently $0 \le (f(n) + g(n)) / 2 \le h(n)$, which shows that

$$h(n) = \max(f(n), g(n)) \ge c_1(f(n) + g(n))$$

for all $n \ge n_0$ (with $c_1 = 1 / 2$ in the definition of $\Theta$).

> Show that for any real constants $a$ and $b$, where $b > 0$,
>
> $$(n + a)^b = \Theta(n^b). \tag{3.2}$$

To show that $(n + a)^b = \Theta(n^b)$, we want to find constants $c_1, c_2, n_0 > 0$ such that $0 \le c_1 n^b \le (n + a)^b \le c_2 n^b$ for all $n \ge n_0$.

Note that

$$
\begin{aligned}
n + a & \le n + |a| & \\\\
      & \le 2n      & \text{ when } |a| \le n,
\end{aligned}
$$

and

$$
\begin{aligned}
n + a & \ge n - |a|           & \\\\
      & \ge \frac{1}{2}n      & \text{ when } |a| \le \frac{1}{2}n.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, when $n \ge 2|a|$,

$$0 \le \frac{1}{2}n \le n + a \le 2n.$$

Since $b > 0$, the inequality still holds when all parts are raised to the power $b$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 \le \Big(\frac{1}{2}n\Big)^b    & \le (n + a)^b \le (2n)^b, \\\\
0 \le \Big(\frac{1}{2}\Big)^b n^b & \le (n + a)^b \le 2^b n^b.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, $c_1 = (1 / 2)^b$, $c_2 = 2^b$, and $n_0 = 2|a|$ satisfy the definition.

> Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm $A$ is at least $O(n^2)$," is meaningless.

Let the running time be $T(n)$. $T(n) \ge O(n^2)$ means that $T(n) \ge f(n)$ for some function $f(n)$ in the set $O(n^2)$. This statement holds for any running time $T(n)$, since the function $g(n) = 0$ for all $n$ is in $O(n^2)$, and running times are always nonnegative. Thus, the statement tells us nothing about the running time.

## 3.1-4

> Is $2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$? Is $2^{2n} = O(2^n)$?

$2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$, but $2^{2n} \ne O(2^n)$.

- To show that $2^{n + 1} = O(2^n)$, we must find constants $c$; $n_0 > 0$ such that

    $$0 \le 2^{n + 1} \le c \cdot 2^n \text{ for all } n \ge n_0.$$

    Since $2^{n + 1} = 2 \cdot 2^n$ for all $n$, we can satisfy the definition with $c = 2$ and $n_0 = 1$.

- To show that $2^{2n} \ne O(2^n)$, assume there exist constants $c, n_0 > 0$ such that

    $$0 \le 2^{2n} \le c \cdot 2^n \text{ for all } n \ge n_0.$$

    Then $2^{2n} = 2^n \cdot 2^n \le c \cdot 2^n \Rightarrow 2^n \le c$. But no constant is greater than all $2^n$, and so the assumption leads to a contradiction.

> Prove Theorem 3.1.

The theorem states:

> For any two functions $f(n)$ and $g(n)$, we have $f(n) = \Theta(g(n))$ if and only if $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$.

From $f = \Theta(g(n))$, we have that

$$0 \le c_1 g(n) \le f(n) \le c_2g(n) \text{ for } n > n_0.$$

We can pick the constants from here and use them in the definitions of $O$ and $\Omega$ to show that both hold.

From $f(n) = \Omega(g(n))$ and $f(n) = O(g(n))$, we have that

$$
\begin{aligned}
            & 0 \le c_3g(n) \le f(n) & \text{ for all } n \ge n_1 \\\\
\text{and } & 0 \le f(n) \le c_4g(n) & \text{ for all } n \ge n_2.
\end{aligned}
$$

If we let $n_3 = \max(n_1, n_2)$ and merge the inequalities, we get

$$0 \le c_3g(n) \le f(n) \le c_4g(n) \text{ for all } n > n_3.$$

Which is the definition of $\Theta$.

## 3.1-6

> Prove that the running time of an algorithm is $\Theta(g(n))$ if and only if its worst-case running time is $O(g(n))$ and its best-case running time is $\Omega(g(n))$.

If $T_w$ is the worst-case running time and $T_b$ is the best-case running time, we know that

$$
\begin{aligned}
            & 0 \le c_1g(n) \le T_b(n) & \text{ for } n > n_b \\\\
\text{and } & 0 \le T_w(n) \le c_2g(n) & \text{ for } n > n_w.
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining them we get

$$0 \le c_1g(n) \le T_b(n) \le T_w(n) \le c_2g(n) \text{ for } n > \max(n_b, n_w).$$

Since the running time is bound between $T_b$ and $T_w$ and the above is the definition of the $\Theta$-notation, proved.

## 3.1-7

> Prove $o(g(n)) \cap w(g(n))$ is the empty set.

We know that for any $c > 0$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
            & \exists n_1 > 0: 0 \le f(n) < cg(n) \\\\
\text{and } & \exists n_2 > 0: 0 \le cg(n) < f(n).
\end{aligned}
$$

If we pick $n_0 = \max(n_1, n_2)$, from the problem definition we get

$$f(n) < cg(n) < f(n).$$

There is no solutions, which means that the intersection is the empty set.
