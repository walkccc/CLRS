## 17.4-1

> Suppose that we wish to implement a dynamic, open-address hash table. Why might we consider the table to be full when its load factor reaches some value $\alpha$ that is strictly less than $1$? Describe briefly how to make insertion into a dynamic, open-address hash table run in such a way that the expected value of the amortized cost per insertion is $O(1)$. Why is the expected value of the actual cost per insertion not necessarily $O(1)$ for all insertions?

By theorems 11.6-11.8, the expected cost of performing insertions and searches in an open address hash table approaches infinity as the load factor approaches one, for any load factor fixed away from $1$, the expected time is bounded by a constant though. The expected value of the actual cost my not be $O(1)$ for every insertion because the actual cost may include copying out the current values from the current table into a larger table because it became too full. This would take time that is linear in the number of elements stored.

> Show that if $\alpha_{i - 1} \ge 1 / 2$ and the $i$th operation on a dynamic table is $\text{TABLE-DELETE}$, then the amortized cost of the operation with respect to the potential function $\text{(17.6)}$ is bounded above by a constant.

If $\alpha_{i - 1} \ge 1 / 2$, $\text{TABLE-DELETE}$ cannot **_contract_**, so $c_i = 1$ and $size_i = size_{i - 1}$.

- **Case 1:** if $\alpha_i \ge 1 / 2$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat c_i & = c_i + \Phi_i - \Phi_{i - 1} \\\\
             & = 1 + (2 \cdot num_i - size_i) - (2 \cdot num_{i - 1} - size_{i - 1}) \\\\
             & = 1 + (2 \cdot (num_{i - 1} - 1) - size_{i - 1}) - (2 \cdot num_{i - 1} - size_{i - 1}) \\\\
             & = -1.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- **Case 2:** if $\alpha_i < 1 / 2$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \hat c_i & =   c_i + \Phi_i - \Phi_{i - 1} \\\\
             & =   1 + (size_i / 2 - num_i) - (2 \cdot num_{i - 1} - size_{i - 1}) \\\\
             & =   1 + (size_{i - 1} / 2 - (num_{i - 1} - 1)) - (2 \cdot num_{i - 1} - size_{i - 1}) \\\\
             & =   2 + \frac{3}{2} size_{i - 1} - 3 \cdot num_{i - 1} \\\\
             & =   2 + \frac{3}{2} size_{i - 1} - 3\alpha_{i - 1} size_{i - 1} \\\\
             & \le 2 + \frac{3}{2} size_{i - 1} - \frac{3}{2} size_{i - 1} \\\\
             & =   2.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## 17.4-3

If $1 / 3 < \alpha_i \le 1 / 2$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat c_i & = c_i + \Phi_i - \Phi_{i - 1} \\\\
         & = 1 + (size_i - 2 \cdot num_i) - (size_i - 2 \cdot (num_i + 1)) \\\\
         & = 3.
\end{aligned}
$$

If the $i$th operation does trigger a contraction,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{3} size_{i - 1} & = num_i + 1 \\\\
            size_{i - 1} & = 3 (num_i + 1) \\\\
            size_{i}     & = \frac{2}{3} size_{i - 1} = 2 (num_i + 1).
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat c_i & = c_i + \Phi_i - \Phi_{i - 1} \\\\
         & = (num_i + 1) + [2 \cdot (num_i + 1) - 2 \cdot num_i] - [3 \cdot (num_i + 1) - 2 \cdot (num_i + 1)] \\\\
         & = 2.
\end{aligned}
$$
