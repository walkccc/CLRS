## 17.2-1

> Suppose we perform a sequence of stack operations on a stack whose size never exceeds $k$. After every $k$ operations, we make a copy of the entire stack for backup purposes. Show that the cost of $n$ stack operations, including copying the stack, is $O(n)$ by assigning suitable amortized costs to the various stack operations.

## 17.2-3

> Suppose we wish not only to increment a counter but also to reset it to zero (i.e., make all bits in it $0$). Counting the time to examine or modify a bit as $\Theta(1)$, show how to implement a counter as an array of bits so that any sequence of $n$ $\text{INCREMENT}$ and $\text{RESET}$ operations takes time $O(n)$ on an initially zero counter. ($\textit{Hint:}$ Keep a pointer to the high-order $1$.)
