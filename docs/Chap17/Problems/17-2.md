> Binary search of a sorted array takes logarithmic search time, but the time to insert a new element is linear in the size of the array. We can improve the time for insertion by keeping several sorted arrays.

> Specifically, suppose that we wish to support $\text{SEARCH}$ and $\text{INSERT}$ on a set of $n$ elements. Let $k = \lceil \lg(n + 1) \rceil$, and let the binary representation of $n$ be $\langle n_{k - 1}, n_{k - 2}, \ldots, n_0 \rangle$. We have $k$ sorted arrays $A_0, A_1, \ldots, A_{k - 1}$, where for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, k - 1$, the length of array $A_i$ is $2^i$. Each array is either full or empty, depending on whether $n_i = 1$ or $n_i = 0$, respectively. The total number of elements held in all $k$ arrays is therefore $\sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} n_i 2^i = n$. Although each individual array is sorted, elements in different arrays bear no particular relationship to each other.
