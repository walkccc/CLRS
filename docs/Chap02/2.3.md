- Base case

    For $n = 2^1$, $T(n) = 2\lg 2 = 2$.

- Suppose $n = 2^k$, $T(n) = n\lg n = 2^k \lg 2^k = 2^kk$.

    For $n = 2^{k + 1}$, 

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    T(n) & = 2T(2^{k + 1} / 2) + 2^{k + 1} \\\\
         & = 2T(2^k) + 2^{k + 1} \\\\
         & = 2 \cdot 2^kk + 2^{k + 1} \\\\
         & = 2^{k + 1}(k + 1) \\\\
         & = 2^{k + 1} \lg 2^{k + 1} \\\\
         & = n\lg n.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

By P.M.I., $T(n) = n\lg n$, when $n$ is an exact power of $2$.

## 2.3-4

> We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort $A[1..n]$, we recursively sort $A[1..n - 1]$ and then insert $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1..n - 1]$. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.

It takes $\Theta(n)$ time in the worst case to insert $A[n]$ into the sorted array $A[1..n - 1]$. Therefore, the recurrence

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    \Theta(1)            & \text{if } n = 1, \\\\
    T(n - 1) + \Theta(n) & \text{if } n > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

The solution of the recurrence is $\Theta(n^2)$.

## 2.3-5

> Referring back to the searching problem (see Exercise 2.1-3), observe that if the sequence $A$ is sorted, we can check the midpoint of the sequence against $v$ and eliminate half of the sequence from further consideration. The **_binary search_** algorithm repeats this procedure, halving the size of the remaining portion of the sequence each time. Write pseudocode, either iterative or recursive, for binary search. Argue that the worst-case running time of binary search is $\Theta(\lg n)$.

- Iterative:

    ```cpp
    ITERATIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, low, high)
        while low ≤ high
            mid = floor((low + high) / 2)
            if v == A[mid]
                return mid
            else if v > A[mid]
                low = mid + 1
            else high = mid - 1
        return NIL
    ```

- Recursive:

    ```cpp
    RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, low, high)
        if low > high
            return NIL
        mid = floor((low + high) / 2)
        if v == A[mid]
            return mid
        else if v > A[mid]
            return RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, mid + 1, high)
        else return RECURSIVE-BINARY-SEARCH(A, v, low, mid - 1)
    ```

Each time we do the comparison of $v$ with the middle element, the search range continues with range halved.

The recurrence

$$
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    \Theta(1)            & \text{if } n = 1, \\\\
    T(n / 2) + \Theta(1) & \text{if } n > 1.
\end{cases}
$$

The solution of the recurrence is $T(n) = \Theta(\lg n)$.

## 2.3-6

> Observe that the **while** loop of lines 5–7 of the $\text{INSERTION-SORT}$ procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray $A[i..j - 1]$. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n\lg n)$?

Each time the **while** loop of lines 5-7 of $\text{INSERTION-SORT}$ scans backward through the sorted array $A[1..j - 1]$. The loop not only searches for the proper place for $A[j]$, but it also moves each of the array elements that are bigger than $A[j]$ one position to the right (line 6). These movements takes $\Theta(j)$ time, which occurs when all the $j - 1$ elements preceding $A[j]$ are larger than $A[j]$. The running time of using binary search to search is $\Theta(\lg j)$, which is still dominated by the running time of moving element $\Theta(j)$.

Therefore, we can't improve the overrall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\Theta(n\lg n)$.
