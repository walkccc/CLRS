**a.** $A'$ consists of the elements in $A$ but in sorted order.

**b.** **Loop invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop of lines 2-4, the subarray $A[j..n]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[j..n]$ before entering the loop but possibly in a different order and the first element $A[j]$ is the smallest among them.

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray contains only the last element $A[n]$, which is trivially the smallest element of the subarray.

**Maintenance:** In every step we compare $A[j]$ with $A[j - 1]$ and make $A[j - 1]$ the smallest among them. After the iteration, the length of the subarray increases by one and the first element is the smallest of the subarray.

**Termination:** The loop terminates when $j = i$. According to the statement of loop invariant, $A[i]$ is the smallest among $A[i..n]$ and $A[i..n]$ consists of the elements originally in $A[i..n]$ before entering the loop.

**c.** **Loop invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop of lines 1-4, the subarray $A[1..i − 1]$ consists of the $i - 1$ smallest elements in $A[1..n]$ in sorted order. $A[i..n]$ consists of the $n - i + 1$ remaining elements in $A[1..n]$.

**Initialization:** Initially the subarray $A[1..i − 1]$ is empty and trivially this is the smallest element of the subarray.

**Maintenance:** From part (b), after the execution of the inner loop, $A[i]$ will be the smallest element of the subarray $A[i..n]$. And in the beginning of the outer loop, $A[1..i − 1]$ consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $A[i..n]$, in sorted order. So, after the execution of the outer loop, subarray $A[1..i]$ will consists of elements that are smaller than the elements of $A[i + 1..n]$, in sorted order.

**Termination:** The loop terminates when $i = A.length$. At that point the array $A[1..n]$ will consists of all elements in sorted order.

**d.** The $i$th iteration of the **for** loop of lines 1-4 will cause $n − i$ iterations of the **for** loop of lines 2-4, each with constant time execution, so the worst-case running time of bubble sort is $\Theta(n^2)$ which is same as the worst-case running time of insertion sort. 

However, insertion sort has best-case running time of $\Theta(n)$ which is faster than the best-case running time $\Theta(n^2)$ of bubble sort.
