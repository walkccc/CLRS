**a.** $\Theta(n)$.

**b.**

```cpp
NAIVE-HORNER()
    y = 0
    for k = 0 to n
        temp = 1
        for i = 0 to k
            temp = temp * x
        y = y + a[k] * temp
```

The running time is $\Theta(n^2)$, because of the nested loop. It is obviously slower.

**c.** **Initialization:** It is pretty trivial, since the summation has no terms which implies $y = 0$.

**Maintenance:** By using the loop invariant, in the end of the $i$-the iteration, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
y & = a_i + x \sum_{k = 0}^{n - (i + 1)} a_{k + i + 1} x^k \\\\
  & = a_i x^0 + \sum_{k = 0}^{n - i - 1} a_{k + i + 1} x^{k + 1} \\\\
  & = a_i x^0 \sum_{k = 1}^{n - i} a_{k + i} x^k \\\\
  & = \sum_{k = 0}^{n - i} a_{k + i} x^k.
\end{aligned}
$$

**Termination:** The loop terminates at $i = -1$. If we substitute,

$$y = \sum_{k = 0}^{n - i - 1} a_{k + i + 1} x^k = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_k x^k.$$

**d.** The invariant of the loop is a sum that equals a polynomial with the given coefficients.
