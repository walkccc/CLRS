## 31.9-1

> Referring to the execution history shown in Figure 31.7(a), when does POLLARDRHO print the factor 73 of 1387?

$x = 84, y = 814$.

## 31.9-2

> Suppose that we are given a function $f : \mathbb{Z}\_n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\_n$ and an initial value $x\_0 \in \mathbb{Z}\_n$. Define $x\_i = f(x\_{i - 1})$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots$. Let $t$ and $u > 0$ be the smallest values such that $x\_{t+i} = x\_{t+u+i}$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots$. In the terminology of Pollard's rho algorithm, $t$ is the length of the tail and $u$ is the length of the cycle of the rho. Give an efficient algorithm to determine $t$ and $u$ exactly, and analyze its running time.

## 31.9-3

> How many steps would you expect POLLARD-RHO to require to discover a factor of the form $p^e$, where $p$ is prime and $e > 1$?

$\Theta(\sqrt{p})$.

## 31.9-4 $\star$
> One disadvantage of POLLARD-RHO as written is that it requires one gcd computation for each step of the recurrence. Instead, we could batch the gcd computations by accumulating the product of several $x\_i$ values in a row and then using this product instead of $x\_i$ in the gcd computation. Describe carefully how you would implement this idea, why it works, and what batch size you would pick as the most effective when working on a $\beta$-bit number $n$.
