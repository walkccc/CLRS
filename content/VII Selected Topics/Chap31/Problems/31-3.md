> This problem compares the efficiency of three methods for computing the $n$th Fibonacci number $F\_n$, given $n$. Assume that the cost of adding, subtracting, or multiplying two numbers is $O(1)$, independent of the size of the numbers.

> **a.** Show that the running time of the straightforward recursive method for computing $F\_n$ based on recurrence (3.22) is exponential in $n$. (See, for example, the FIB procedure on page 775.)

> **b.** Show how to compute $F\_n$ in $O(n)$ time using memoization.

> **c.** Show how to compute $F\_n$ in $O(\lg n)$ time using only integer addition and multiplication.
(Hint: Consider the matrix

> $\displaystyle \left (
\begin{matrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{matrix}
\right )
{equation}
> and its powers.)

> **d.** Assume now that adding two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta)$ time and that multiplying two $\beta$-bit numbers takes $\Theta(\beta^2)$ time. What is the running time of these three methods under this more reasonable cost measure for the elementary arithmetic operations?

**a.** $T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 2) + \Theta(1) = \Theta(2^n).{equation}
**b.**
```python
def fib(n):
    fibs = [0, 1] + [-1] * (n - 1)

    def fib\_sub(n):
        if fibs[n] == -1:
            fibs[n] = fib\_sub(n - 1) + fib\_sub(n - 2)
        return fibs[n]
    return fib\_sub(n)
```
**c.**

**d.**

1. $\Theta(2^{2^\beta})$.
2. $\Theta(2^\beta)$.
3. $T(n) = T(n / 2) + \Theta(\beta^2) = \Theta(\beta^3)$.
