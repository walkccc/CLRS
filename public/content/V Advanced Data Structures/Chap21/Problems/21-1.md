menuTitle: "Problem 21-1"
---

> The __*off-line minimum problem*__ asks us to maintain a dynamic set $T$ of elements from the domain $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ under the operations $\text{INSERT}$ and $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$. We are given a sequence $S$ of $n$ $\text{INSERT}$ and $m$ $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ calls, where each key in $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is inserted exactly once. We wish to determine which key is returned by each $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ call. Specifically, we wish to fill in an array $extracted[1 \ldots m]$, where for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, m$, $extracted[i]$ is the key returned by the $i$th $\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ call. The problem is "off-line" in the sense that we are allowed to process the entire sequence $S$ before determining any of the returned keys.

For each subsequence $\text{I}\_j$ , we initially place the keys inserted by these operations into a set $K\_j$, which is empty if $\text{I}\_j$ is empty. We then do the following:

**a.** For the input sequence

<div>
$$
\text{4, 8, E, 3, E, 9, 2, 6, E, E, E, 1, 7, E, 5},
$$
</div>

the values in the $extracted$ array would be $4, 3, 2, 6, 8, 1$.

The following table shows the situation after the $i$th iteration of the **for** loop when we use $\text{OFF-LINE-MINIMUM}$ on the same input. (For this input, $n = 9$ and $m$—the number of extractions—is $6$).
