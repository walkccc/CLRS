For this situation, every interval will be within the \"middle\" region since the \"left\" and \"right\" subarrays will be empty, lines 6 and 7 of $\\text{FUZZY-SORT}$ are $\\Theta(1)$. As a result, there is no recursion and the running time of $\\text{FUZZY-SORT}$ is determined by the $\\Theta(n)$ running time required to find the region of overlap.

All red jugs hold different amounts of water, as do the blue ones. Moreover, for every red jug, there is a blue jug that holds the same amount of water, and vice versa.</p> <p>Your task is to find a grouping of the jugs into pairs of red and blue jugs that hold the same amount of water. To do so, you may perform the following operation: pick a pair of jugs in which one is red and one is blue, fill the red jug with water, and then pour the water into the blue jug. This operation will tell you whether the red or the blue jug can hold more water, or that they have the same volume. Assume that such a comparison takes one time unit. Your goal is to find an algorithm that makes a minimum number of comparisons to determine the grouping. Remember that you may not directly compare two red jugs or two blue jugs.</p> <p>a.

Give a randomized algorithm whose expected number of comparisons is $O(n\\lg n)$, and prove that this bound is correct. What is the worst-case number of comparisons for your algorithm?</p> <p>a. Select a red jug. Compare it to blue jugs until you find one which matches. Set that pair aside, and repeat for the next red jug. This will use at most $\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i = n(n - 1) / 2 = \\Theta(n^2)$ comparisons.</p> <p>b. We can imagine first lining up the red jugs in some order. Then a solution to this problem becomes a permutation of the blue jugs such that the $i$th blue jug is the same size as the $i$th red jug. As in section 8.1, we can make a decision tree which represents comparisons made between blue jugs and red jugs. An internal node represents a comparison between a specific pair of red and blue jugs, and a leaf node represents a permutation of the blue jugs based on the results of the comparison. We are interested in when one jug is greater than, less than, or equal in size to another jug, so the tree should have $3$ children per node. Since there must be at least $n!$ leaf nodes, the decision tree must have height at least $\\log_3 (n!)$. Since a solution corresponds to a simple path from root to leaf, an algorithm must make at least $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ comparisons to reach any leaf.</p> <p>c. We use an algorithm analogous to randomized quicksort. Select a blue jug at random. Partition the red jugs into those which are smaller than the blue jug, and those which are larger. At some point in the comparisons, you will find the red jug which is of equal size. Once the red jugs have been divided by size, use the red jug of equal size to partition the blue jugs into those which are smaller and those which are larger. If $k$ red jugs are smaller than the originally chosen jug, we need to solve the original problem on input of size $k \u2212 1$ and size $n \u2212 k$, which we will do in the same manner. A subproblem of size $1$ is trivially solved because if there is only one red jug and one blue jug, they must be the same size. The analysis of expected number of comparisons is exactly the same as that of $\\text{RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT}$ given on pages 181-184. We are running the procedure twice so the expected number of comparisons is doubled, but this is absorbed by the big-$O$ notation.

Assume that an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm $\\text X$ fails to correctly sort the array $A[1..n]$. Let $A[p]$ be the smallest value in $A$ that algorithm $\\text X$ puts into the wrong location, and let $A[q]$ be the value that algorithm $\\text X$ moves to the location into which $A[p]$ should have gone.

Analyze the running time of each operation in terms of the size of the dynamic set(s) being operated on.</p> <p>a. Lists are sorted.</p> <p>b. Lists are unsorted.</p> <p>c. Lists are unsorted, and dynamic sets to be merged are disjoint.</p> <p>In all three cases, $\\text{MAKE-HEAP}$ simply creates a new list $L$, sets $L.head = \\text{NIL}$, and returns $L$ in constant time. Assume lists are doubly linked. To realize a linked list as a heap, we imagine the usual array implementation of a binary heap, where the children of the $i$th element are $2i$ and $2i + 1$.</p> <p>a. To insert, we perform a linear scan to see where to insert an element such that the list remains sorted. This takes linear time. The first element in the list is the minimum element, and we can find it in constant time. $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ returns the first element of the list, then deletes it. Union performs a merge operation between the two sorted lists, interleaving their entries such that the resulting list is sorted. This takes time linear in the sum of the lengths of the two lists.</p> <p>b. To insert an element $x$ into the heap, begin linearly scanning the list until the first instance of an element $y$ which is strictly larger than $x$. If no such larger element exists, simply insert $x$ at the end of the list. If $y$ does exist, replace $y \\text t$ by $x$.</p> <p>This maintains the min-heap property because $x \\le y$ and $y$ was smaller than each of its children, so $x$ must be as well.</p> <p>Moreover, $x$ is larger than its parent because $y$ was the first element in the list to exceed $x$. Now insert $y$, starting the scan at the node following $x$. Since we check each node at most once, the time is linear in the size of the list.</p> <p>To get the minimum element, return the key of the head of the list in constant time.</p> <p>To extract the minimum element, we first call $\\text{MINIMUM}$. Next, we'll replace the key of the head of the list by the key of the second smallest element $y$ in the list. We'll take the key stored at the end of the list and use it to replace the key of $y$. Finally, we'll delete the last element of the list, and call $\\text{MIN-HEAPIFY}$ on the list.</p> <p>To implement this with linked lists, we need to step through the list to get from element $i$ to element $2i$. We omit this detail from the code, but we'll consider it for runtime analysis.

The for loop on lines 2\u20137 will get run exactly $t$ times, each of which is constant runtime. After that, the while loop on lines 8\u20139 will be run exactly $X_t$ times.

So, we need to show that $\\Pr\\{X_t \\ge i\\} \\le (1 - i / n)^t$. This can be seen because having $X_t$ being greater than $i$ means that each random choice will result in an element that is either at least $i$ steps before the desired element, or is after the desired element. There are $n - i$ such elements, out of the total $n$ elements that we were pricking from. So, for a single one of the choices to be from such a range, we have a probability of $(n - i) / n = (1 - i / n)$. Since each of the selections was independent, the total probability that all of them were is $(1 - i / n)^t$, as desired. Lastly, we can note that since the linked list has length $n$, the probability that $X_t$ is greater than $n$ is equal to zero.</p> <p>d.

We just put together parts (b) and (e) to get that it runs in time $O(t + n / (t + 1))$. But, this is the same as $O(t + n / t)$.</p> <p>g. Since we have that for any number of iterations $t$ that the first algorithm takes to find its answer, the second algorithm will return it in time $O(t + n / t)$. In particular, if we just have that $t = \\sqrt n$. The second algorithm takes time only $O(\\sqrt n)$. This means that tihe first list search algorithm is $O(\\sqrt n)$ as well.</p> <p>h. If we don't have distinct key values, then, we may randomly select an element that is further along than we had been before, but not jump to it because it has the same key as what we were currently at.

As we saw in Section 12.4, however, randomly built binary search trees tend to be balanced. Therefore, one strategy that, on average, builds a balanced tree for a fixed set of items would be to randomly permute the items and then insert them in that order into the tree.</p> <p>What if we do not have all the items at once? If we receive the items one at a time, can we still randomly build a binary search tree out of them?</p> <p>We will examine a data structure that answers this question in the affirmative. A treap is a binary search tree with a modified way of ordering the nodes. Figure 13.9 shows an example. As usual, each node $x$ in the tree has a key value $x.key$. In addition, we assign $x.priority$, which is a random number chosen independently for each node. We assume that all priorities are distinct and also that all keys are distinct. The nodes of the treap are ordered so that the keys obey the binary-search-tree property and the priorities obey the min-heap order property:</p> <ul> <li>If $v$ is a left child of $u$, then $v.key &lt; u.key$.</li> <li>If $v$ is a right child of $u$, then $v.key &gt; u.key$.</li> <li>If $v$ is a child of $u$, then $v.priority &gt; u.priority$.</li> </ul> <p>(This combination of properties is why the tree is called a \"treap\": it has features of both a binary search tree and a heap.)</p> <p>It helps to think of treaps in the following way. Suppose that we insert nodes $x_1, x_2, \\ldots,x_n$, with associated keys, into a treap. Then the resulting treap is the tree that would have been formed if the nodes had been inserted into a normal binary search tree in the order given by their (randomly chosen) priorities, i.e., $x_i.priority &lt; x_j.priority$ means that we had inserted $x_i$ before $x_j$.</p> <p>a.

Although these two operations have the same expected running time, they have different costs in practice. A search reads information from the treap without modifying it. In contrast, a rotation changes parent and child pointers within the treap. On most computers, read operations are much faster than write operations. Thus we would like $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ to perform few rotations.

In other words, the left spine is the simple path from the root that consists of only left edges. Symmetrically, the right spine of $T$ is the simple path from the root consisting of only right edges. The length of a spine is the number of nodes it contains.</p> <p>e. Consider the treap $T$ immediately after $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ has inserted node $x$. Let $C$ be the length of the right spine of the left subtree of $x$. Let $D$ be the length of the left spine of the right subtree of $x$. Prove that the total number of rotations that were performed during the insertion of $x$ is equal to $C + D$.</p> <p>We will now calculate the expected values of $C$ and $D$. Without loss of generality, we assume that the keys are $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ since we are comparing them only to one another.</p> <p>For nodes $x$ and $y$ in treap $T$, where $y \\ne x$, let $k = x.key$ and $i = y.key$.

Conclude that the expected number of rotations performed when inserting a node into a treap is less than $2$.</p> <p>a. The root is the node with smallest priority, the root divides the sets into two subsets based on the key. In each subset, the node with smallest priority is selected as the root, thus we can uniquely determine a treap with a specific input.</p> <p>b. For the priority of all nodes, each permutation corresponds to exactly one treap, that is, all nodes forms a BST in priority, since the priority of all nodes is spontaneous, treap is, essentially, randomly built binary search tress. Therefore, the expected height of a treap is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.</p> <p>c. First insert a node as usual using the binary-search-tree insertion procedure.

You realize that instead of directly exchanging one currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the currency you want. Suppose that you can trade $n$ different currencies, numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where you start with currency $1$ and wish to wind up with currency $n$. You are given, for each pair of currencies $i$ and $j$ , an exchange rate $r_{ij}$, meaning that if you start with $d$ units of currency $i$ , you can trade for $dr_{ij}$ units of currency $j$. A sequence of trades may entail a commission, which depends on the number of trades you make. Let $c_k$ be the commission that you are charged when you make $k$ trades. Show that, if $c_k = 0$ for all $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ exhibits optimal substructure. Then show that if commissions $c_k$ are arbitrary values, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ does not necessarily exhibit optimal substructure.</p> <p>First we assume that the commission is always zero. Let $k$ denote a currency which appears in an optimal sequence $s$ of trades to go from currency $1$ to currency $n$. $p_k$ denote the first part of this sequence which changes currencies from $1$ to $k$ and $q_k$ denote the rest of the sequence. Then $p_k$ and $q_k$ are both optimal sequences for changing from $1$ to $k$ and $k$ to $n$ respectively. To see this, suppose that $p_k$ wasn't optimal but that $p_k'$ was. Then by changing currencies according to the sequence $p_k'q_k$ we would have a sequence of changes which is better than $s$, a contradiction since $s$ was optimal.

Amalgamated Investments requires you to observe the following rules. It offers $n$ different investments, numbered $1$ through $n$. In each year $j$, investment $i$ provides a return rate of $r_{ij}$ . In other words, if you invest $d$ dollars in investment $i$ in year $j$, then at the end of year $j$ , you have $dr_{ij}$ dollars. The return rates are guaranteed, that is, you are given all the return rates for the next 10 years for each investment. You make investment decisions only once per year. At the end of each year, you can leave the money made in the previous year in the same investments, or you can shift money to other investments, by either shifting money between existing investments or moving money to a new investement. If you do not move your money between two consecutive years, you pay a fee of $f_1$ dollars, whereas if you switch your money, you pay a fee of $f_2$ dollars, where $f_2 &gt; f_1$.</p> <p>a. The problem, as stated, allows you to invest your money inmultiple investments in each year. Prove that there exists an optimal investment strategy that, in each year, puts all the money into a single investment. (Recall that an optimal investment strategy maximizes the amount of money after 10 years and is not concerned with any other objectives, such as minimizing risk.)</p> <p>b. Prove that the problem of planning your optimal investment strategy exhibits optimal substructure.</p> <p>c. Design an algorithm that plans your optimal investment strategy. What is the running time of your algorithm?</p> <p>d. Suppose that Amalgamated Investments imposed the additional restriction that, at any point, you can have no more than $\\$15,000$ in any one investment. Show that the problem of maximizing your income at the end of 10 years no longer exhibits optimal substructure.</p> <p>a. Without loss of generality, suppose that there exists an optimal solution $S$ which involves investing $d_1$ dollars into investment $k$ and $d_2$ dollars into investement $m$ in year $1$. Further, suppose in this optimal solution, you don't move your money for the first $j$ years. If $r_{k1} + r_{k2} + \\ldots + r_{kj} &gt; r_{m1} +r_{m2} + \\ldots + r_{mj}$ then we can perform the usual cut-and-paste maneuver and instead invest $d_1 + d_2$ dollars into investment $k$ for $j$ years. Keeping all other investments the same, this results in a strategy which is at least as profitable as $S$, but has reduced the number of different investments in a given span of years by $1$. Continuing in this way, we can reduce the optimal strategy to consist of only a single investment each year.</p> <p>b. If a particular investment strategy is the year-one-plan for a optimal investment strategy, then we must solve two kinds of optimal suproblem: either we maintain the strategy for an additional year, not incurring the moneymoving fee, or we move the money, which amounts to solving the problem where we ignore all information from year $1$. Thus, the problem exhibits optimal substructure.</p> <p>c. The algorithm works as follows: We build tables $I$ and $R$ of size $10$ such that $I[i]$ tells which investment should be made (with all money) in year $i$, and $R[i]$ gives the total return on the investment strategy in years $i$ through $10$.</p> <pre><code>INVEST(d, n)\n    let I[1..10] and R[1..10] be new tables\n    for k = 10 downto 1\n        q = 1\n        for i = 1 to n\n            if r[i, k] &gt; r[q, k]   // i now holds the investment which looks best for a given year\n                q = i\n        if R[k + 1] + dr_{I[k + 1]k} - f[1] &gt; R[k + 1] +  dr[q, k] - f[2]  // If revenue is greater when money is not moved\n            R[k] = R[k + 1] + dr_{I[k + 1]k} - f[1]\n            I[k] = I[k + 1]\n        else\n            R[k] = R[k + 1] + dr[q, k] - f[2]\n            I[k] = q\n    return I as an optimal stategy with return R[1]\n</code></pre> <p>d. The previous investment strategy was independent of the amount of money you started with. When there is a cap on the amount you can invest, the amount you have to invest in the next year becomes relevant. If we know the year-one-strategy of an optimal investment, and we know that we need to move money after the first year, we're left with the problem of investing a different initial amount of money, so we'd have to solve a subproblem for every possible initial amount of money.

We use an array $z$\u2014assumed to be large enough to hold all the characters it will need\u2014to hold the intermediate results. Initially, $z$ is empty, and at termination, we should have $z[j] = y[j]$ for $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. We maintain current indices $i$ into $x$ and $j$ into $z$, and the operations are allowed to alter $z$ and these indices. Initially, $i = j = 1$.

We also assume that the individual costs of the copy and replace operations are less than the combined costs of the delete and insert operations; otherwise, the copy and replace operations would not be used. The cost of a given sequence of transformation operations is the sum of the costs of the individual operations in the sequence.

Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm.</p> <p>The edit-distance problem generalizes the problem of aligning two DNA sequences (see, for example, Setubal and Meidanis [310, Section 3.2]). There are several methods for measuring the similarity of two DNA sequences by aligning them. One such method to align two sequences $x$ and $y$ consists of inserting spaces at arbitrary locations in the two sequences (including at either end) so that the resulting sequences $x'$ and $y'$ have the same length but do not have a space in the same position (i.e., for no position $j$ are both $x'[j]$ and $y'[j]$ a space). Then we assign a \"score\" to each position. Position $j$ receives a score as follows:</p> <ul> <li>$+1$ if $x'[j] = y'[j]$ and neither is a space,</li> <li>$-1$ if $x'[j] \\ne y'[j]$ and neither is a space,</li> <li>$-2$ if either $x'[j]$ or $y'[j]$ is a space.</li> </ul> <p>The score for the alignment is the sum of the scores of the individual positions.

Explain how to cast the problem of finding an optimal alignment as an edit distance problem using a subset of the transformation operations copy, replace, delete, insert, twiddle, and kill.</p> <p>a.

Therefore we are required also to show, that some optimal code exists. It is trivial in this case, since we know that the code produced by a run of Huffman's algorithm produce one such code for us. However, it is good to be aware of this. Proving just the implication \"if a code is optimal then it has the desired property\" doesn't suffice.</p> <p>OK, now we are ready to prove the already mentioned implication \"if a code is optimal then it has the desired property\". Main idea of our proof is that if the code violates desired property, then we find two symbols which violate the property and 'fix the code'. For the formal proof we go as follows.</p> <p>Suppose that we have an alphabet $C = {a_1, \\ldots, a_n}$ where the characters are written in monotonically decreasing order, i.e. $a_1.freq \\ge a_2.freq \\ge \\ldots \\ge a_n$. Let us consider an optimal code $B$ for $C$. Let us denote the codeword for the character $c \\in C$ in the code $B$ by $cw_B(c)$. W.l.o.g. we can assume that for any $i$ such that $a_i.freq = a_{i + 1}.freq$ it holds that $|cw(a_i)| \\le |cw(a_{i + 1})|$. This assumption can be made since for any $a_i.freq = a_{i + 1}.freq$ for which $|cw(a_i)| &gt; |cw(a_{i + 1})|$ we can simply swap codewords for $a_i$ and $a_{i + 1}$ and obtain a code with desired property and the same cost as is the cost of $B$. We prove that $B$ has the desired property, i.e., its codeword lengths are monotonically increasing.</p> <p>We proceed by contradiction. If lengths of the codewords are not monotonically increasing, then there exist an index $i$ such that $|cw_B(a_i)| &gt; |cw_B(a_{i + 1})| $. Using our assumptions on $C$ and $B$ we get that $a_i.freq &gt; a_{i + 1}.freq$. Define new code $B'$ for $C$ such that for $a_j$ such that $j \\ne i$ and $j \\ne i + 1$ we keep $cw_{B'}(a_j) = cw_B(a_j)$ and we swap codewords for $a_i$ and $a_{j + 1}$, i.e. we set $cw_{B'}(a_i) = cw_{B}(a_{i + 1})$ and $cw_{B'}(a_{i + 1}) = cw_{B}(a_{i})$.

Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and state the running time of your algorithm.</p> <p>b. Suppose now that the tasks are not all available at once. That is, each task cannot start until its release time $r_i$. Suppose also that we allow preemption, so that a task can be suspended and restarted at a later time. For example, a task $a_i$ with processing time $p_i = 6$ and release time $r_i = 1$ might start running at time $1$ and be preempted at time $4$. It might then resume at time $10$ but be preempted at time $11$, and it might finally resume at time $13$ and complete at time $15$. Task $a_i$ has run for a total of $6$ time units, but its running time has been divided into three pieces. In this scenario, $a_i$'s completion time is $15$. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the average completion time in this new scenario. Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and state the running time of your algorithm.</p> <p>a. Order the tasks by processing time from smallest to largest and run them in that order. To see that this greedy solution is optimal, first observe that the problem exhibits optimal substructure: if we run the first task in an optimal solution, then we obtain an optimal solution by running the remaining tasks in a way which minimizes the average completion time. Let $O$ be an optimal solution. Let $a$ be the task which has the smallest processing time and let b be the first task run in $O$. Let $G$ be the solution obtained by switching the order in which we run $a$ and $b$ in $O$. This amounts reducing the completion times of a and the completion times of all tasks in $G$ between $a$ and $b$ by the difference in processing times of $a$ and $b$. Since all other completion times remain the same, the average completion time of $G$ is less than or equal to the average completion time of $O$, proving that the greedy solution gives an optimal solution. This has runtime $O(n\\lg n)$ because we must first sort the elements.</p> <p>b. Without loss of generality we my assume that every task is a unit time task. Apply the same strategy as in part (a), except this time if a task which we would like to add next to the schedule isn't allowed to run yet, we must skip over it. Since there could be many tasks of short processing time which have late release time, the runtime becomes $O(n^2)$ since we might have to spend $O(n)$ time deciding which task to add next at each step.</p>"},{"location":"Chap16/Problems/16-3/","title":"16-3 Acyclic subgraphs","text":"<p>a.

Argue that if a set of columns of $M$ is linearly independent, then the corresponding set of edges does not contain a directed cycle.</p> <p>e. Exercise 16.4-2 tells us that the set of linearly independent sets of columns of any matrix $M$ forms a matroid. Explain carefully why the results of parts (d) and (e) are not contradictory. How can there fail to be a perfect correspondence between the notion of a set of edges being acyclic and the notion of the associated set of columns of the incidence matrix being linearly independent?</p> <p>a. First, suppose that a set of columns is not linearly independent over $\\mathbb F_2$ then, there is some subset of those columns, say $S$ so that a linear combination of $S$ is $0$. However, over $\\mathbb F_2$, since the only two elements are $1$ and $0$, a linear combination is a sum over some subset.</p> <p>Suppose that this subset is $S'$, note that it has to be nonempty because of linear dependence. Now, consider the set of edges that these columns correspond to. Since the columns had their total incidence with each vertex $0$ in $\\mathbb F_2$, it is even. So, if we consider the subgraph on these edges, then every vertex has a even degree. Also, since our $S'$ was nonempty, some component has an edge. Restrict our attention to any such component. Since this component is connected and has all even vertex degrees, it contains an Euler Circuit, which is a cycle.</p> <p>Now, suppose that our graph had some subset of edges which was a cycle. Then, the degree of any vertex with respect to this set of edges is even, so, when we add the corresponding columns, we will get a zero column in $\\mathbb F_2$. Since sets of linear independent columns form a matroid, by problem 16.4-2, the acyclic sets of edges form a matroid as well.</p> <p>b. One simple approach is to take the highest weight edge that doesn't complete a cycle. Another way to phrase this is by running Kruskal's algorithm (see Chapter 23) on the graph with negated edge weights.</p> <p>c. Consider the digraph on [3] with the edges $(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)$ where $(u, v)$ indicates there is an edge from $u$ to $v$. Then, consider the two acyclic subsets of edges $B = (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1)$ and $A = (1, 2), (2, 3)$. Then, adding any edge in $B - A$ to $A$ will create a cycle. So, the exchange property is violated.</p> <p>d. Suppose that the graph contained a directed cycle consisting of edges corresponding to columns $S$. Then, since each vertex that is involved in this cycle has exactly as many edges going out of it as going into it, the rows corresponding to each vertex will add up to zero, since the outgoing edges count negative and the incoming vertices count positive. This means that the sum of the columns in $S$ is zero, so, the columns were not linearly independent.</p> <p>e. There is not a perfect correspondence because we didn't show that not containing a directed cycle means that the columns are linearly independent, so there is not perfect correspondence between these sets of independent columns (which we know to be a matriod) and the acyclic sets of edges (which we know not to be a matroid).</p>"},{"location":"Chap16/Problems/16-4/","title":"16-4 Scheduling variations","text":"<p>Consider the following algorithm for the problem from Section 16.5 of scheduling unit-time tasks with deadlines and penalties.

Even though a program may access large amounts of data, by storing a small subset of the main memory in the cache\u2014a small but faster memory\u2014overall access time can greatly decrease. When a computer program executes, it makes a sequence $\\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\rangle$ of $n$ memory requests, where each request is for a particular data element. For example, a program that accesses 4 distinct elements $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ might make the sequence of requests $\\langle d, b, d, b, d, a, c, d, b, a, c, b \\rangle$. Let $k$ be the size of the cache. When the cache contains $k$ elements and the program requests the $(k + 1)$st element, the system must decide, for this and each subsequent request, which $k$ elements to keep in the cache. More precisely, for each request $r_i$, the cache-management algorithm checks whether element $r_i$ is already in the cache. If it is, then we have a cache hit; otherwise, we have a cache miss. Upon a cache miss, the system retrieves $r_i$ from the main memory, and the cache-management algorithm must decide whether to keep $r_i$ in the cache. If it decides to keep $r_i$ and the cache already holds $k$ elements, then it must evict one element to make room for $r_i$ . The cache-management algorithm evicts data with the goal of minimizing the number of cache misses over the entire sequence of requests.</p> <p>Typically, caching is an on-line problem. That is, we have to make decisions about which data to keep in the cache without knowing the future requests. Here, however, we consider the off-line version of this problem, in which we are given in advance the entire sequence of $n$ requests and the cache size $k$, and we wish to minimize the total number of cache misses.</p> <p>We can solve this off-line problem by a greedy strategy called furthest-in-future, which chooses to evict the item in the cache whose next access in the request sequence comes furthest in the future.</p> <p>a. Write pseudocode for a cache manager that uses the furthest-in-future strategy. The input should be a sequence $\\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\rangle$ of requests and a cache size $k$, and the output should be a sequence of decisions about which data element (if any) to evict upon each request.

Prove that furthest-in-future produces the minimum possible number of cache misses.</p> <p>a. Suppose there are $m$ distinct elements that could be requested. There may be some room for improvement in terms of keeping track of the furthest in future element at each position. If you maintain a (double circular) linked list with a node for each possible cache element and an array so that in index $i$ there is a pointer corresponding to the node in the linked list corresponding to the possible cache request $i$. Then, starting with the elements in an arbitrary order, process the sequence $\\langle r_1, \\dots, r_n \\rangle$ from right to left. Upon processing a request move the node corresponding to that request to the beginning of the linked list and make a note in some other array of length $n$ of the element at the end of the linked list. This element is tied for furthest-in-future. Then, just scan left to right through the sequence, each time just checking some set for which elements are currently in the cache. It can be done in constant time to check if an element is in the cache or not by a direct address table. If an element need be evicted, evict the furthest-in-future one noted earlier. This algorithm will take time $O(n + m)$ and use additional space $O(m + n)$.</p> <p>If we were in the stupid case that $m &gt; n$, we could restrict our attention to the possible cache requests that actually happen, so we have a solution that is $O(n)$ both in time and in additional space required.</p> <p>b. Index the subproblems $c[i, S]$ by a number $i \\in [n]$ and a subset $S \\in \\binom{[m]}{k}$. Which indicates the lowest number of misses that can be achieved with an initial cache of $S$ starting after index $i$.

At each time we need to add something new, we can pick which entry to evict from the cache. We need to show the there is an exchange property. That is, if we are at round $i$ and need to evict someone, suppose we evict $x$. Then, if we were to instead evict the furthest in future element $y$, we would have no more evictions than before. To see this, since we evicted $x$, we will have to evict someone else once we get to $x$, whereas, if we had used the other strategy, we wouldn't of had to evict anyone until we got to $y$. This is a point later in time than when we had to evict someone to put $x$ back into the cache, so we could, at reloading $y$, just evict the person we would of evicted when we evicted someone to reload $x$. This causes the same number of misses unless there was an access to that element that wold of been evicted at reloading $x$ some point in between when $x$ any $y$ were needed, in which case furthest in future would be better.</p>"},{"location":"Chap17/17.1/","title":"17.1 Aggregate analysis","text":""},{"location":"Chap17/17.1/#171-1","title":"17.1-1","text":"<p>If the set of stack operations included a $\\text{MULTIPUSH}$ operation, which pushses $k$ items onto the stack, would the $O(1)$ bound on the amortized cost of stack operations continue to hold?</p> <p>No. The time complexity of such a series of operations depends on the number of pushes (pops vice versa) could be made.

Then, once the inorder traversal is written down, we can convert it back to a binary tree by selecting the median of the list to be the root, and recursing on the two halves of the list that remain on both sides.

Let us define, for each node $x$,</p> <p>$$ w(x) = \\begin{cases}     0 &amp; \\text{ if } x \\text{ is red}, \\\\     1 &amp; \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has no red children}, \\\\     0 &amp; \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has one red children}, \\\\     2 &amp; \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has two red children}. \\end{cases} $$</p> <p>Now we redefine the potential of a red-black tree $T$ as</p> <p>$$\\Phi(T) = \\sum_{x \\in T} w(x),$$</p> <p>and let $T'$ be the tree that results from applying any nonterminating case of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ or $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ to $T$.</p> <p>f. Show that $\\Phi(T') \\le \\Phi(T) - 1$ for all nonterminating cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ is $O(1)$.</p> <p>g. Show that $\\Phi(T') \\le \\Phi(T) - 1$ for all nonterminating cases of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ is $O(1)$.</p> <p>h. Complete the proof that in the worst case, any sequence of $m$ $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ operations performs $O(m)$ structural modifications.</p> <p>a. If we insert a node into a complete binary search tree whose lowest level is all red, then there will be $\\Omega(\\lg n)$ instances of case 1 required to switch the colors all the way up the tree. If we delete a node from an all-black, complete binary tree then this also requires $\\Omega(\\lg n)$ time because there will be instances of case 2 at each iteration of the while loop.</p> <p>b. For $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, cases 2 and 3 are terminating. For $\\text{RB-DELETE}$, cases 1 and 3 are terminating.</p> <p>c. After applying case 1, $z$'s parent and uncle have been changed to black and $z$'s grandparent is changed to red. Thus, there is a ned loss of one red node, so $\\Phi(T') = \\Phi(T) \u2212 1$.</p> <p>d. For case 1, there is a single decrease in the number of red nodes, and thus a decrease in the potential function. However, a single call to $\\text{RB-INSERTFIXUP}$ could result in $\\Omega(\\lg n)$ instances of case 1. For cases 2 and 3, the colors stay the same and each performs a rotation.</p> <p>e. Since each instance of case 1 requires a specific node to be red, it can't decrease the number of red nodes by more than $\\Phi(T)$. Therefore the potential function is always non-negative. Any insert can increase the number of red nodes by at most $1$, and one unit of potential can pay for any structural modifications of any of the 3 cases. Note that in the worst case, the call to $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ has to perform $k$ case-1 operations, where $k$ is equal to $\\Phi(T_i) \u2212 \\Phi(T_{i \u2212 1})$. Thus, the total amortized cost is bounded above by $2(\\Phi(T_n) \u2212 \\Phi(T_0)) \\le n$, so the amortized cost of each insert is $O(1)$.</p> <p>f. In case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, we reduce the number of black nodes with two red children by $1$ and we at most increase the number of black nodes with no red children by $1$, leaving a net loss of at most $1$ to the potential function. In our new potential function, $\\Phi(T_n) \u2212 \\Phi(T_0) \\le n$. Since one unit of potential pays for each operation and the terminating cases cause constant structural changes, the total amortized cost is $O(n)$ making the amortized cost of each $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ $O(1)$.</p> <p>g. In case 2 of $\\text{RB-DELETE}$, we reduce the number of black nodes with two red children by $1$, thereby reducing the potential function by $2$. Since the change in potential is at least negative $1$, it pays for the structural modifications. Since the other cases cause constant structural changes, the total amortized cost is $O(n)$ making the amortized cost of each $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ $O(1)$.</p> <p>h. As described above, whether we insert or delete in any of the cases, the potential function always pays for the changes made if they're nonterminating. If they're terminating then they already take constant time, so the amortized cost of any operation in a sequence of $m$ inserts and deletes is $O(1)$, making the toal amortized cost $O(m)$.</p>"},{"location":"Chap17/Problems/17-5/","title":"17-5 Competitive analysis of self-organizing lists with move-to-front","text":"<p>A self-organizing list is a linked list of $n$ elements, in which each element has a unique key. When we search for an element in the list, we are given a key, and we want to find an element with that key.</p> <p>A self-organizing list has two important properties:</p> <ol> <li>To find an element in the list, given its key, we must traverse the list from the beginning until we encounter the element with the given key. If that element is the $k$th element from the start of the list, then the cost to find the element is $k$.</li> <li>We may reorder the list elements after any operation, according to a given rule with a given cost. We may choose any heuristic we like to decide how to reorder the list.</li> </ol> <p>Assume that we start with a given list of $n$ elements, and we are given an access sequence $\\sigma = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_m \\rangle$ of keys to find, in order. The cost of the sequence is the sum of the costs of the individual accesses in the sequence.</p> <p>Out of the various possible ways to reorder the list after an operation, this problem focuses on transposing adjacent list elements-switching their positions in the list\u2014with a unit cost for each transpose operation. You will show, by means of a potential function, that a particular heuristic for reordering the list, move-to-front, entails a total cost no worse than $4$ times that of any other heuristic for maintaining the list order\u2014even if the other heuristic knows the access sequence in advance! We call this type of analysis a competitive analysis.</p> <p>For a heuristic $H$ and a given initial ordering of the list, denote the access cost of sequence $\\sigma$ by $C_H(\\sigma)$ Let $m$ be the number of accesses in $\\sigma$.</p> <p>a. Argue that if heuristic $\\text H$ does not know the access sequence in advance, then the worst-case cost for $\\text H$ on an access sequence $\\sigma$ is $C_H(\\sigma) = \\Omega(mn)$.</p> <p>With the move-to-front heuristic, immediately after searching for an element $x$, we move $x$ to the first position on the list (i.e., the front of the list).</p> <p>Let $\\text{rank}_L(x)$ denote the rank of element $x$ in list $L$, that is, the position of $x$ in list $L$. For example, if $x$ is the fourth element in $L$, then $\\text{rank}_L(x) = 4$. Let $c_i$ denote the cost of access $\\sigma_i$ using the move-to-front heuristic, which includes the cost of finding the element in the list and the cost of moving it to the front of the list by a series of transpositions of adjacent list elements.</p> <p>b. Show that if $\\sigma_i$ accesses element $x$ in list $L$ using the move-to-front heuristic, then $c_i = 2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$.</p> <p>Now we compare move-to-front with any other heuristic $\\text H$ that processes an access sequence according to the two properties above. Heuristic $\\text H$ may transpose elements in the list in any way it wants, and it might even know the entire access sequence in advance.</p> <p>Let $L_i$ be the list after access $\\sigma_i$ using move-to-front, and let $L_i^*$ be the list after access $\\sigma_i$ using heuristic $\\text H$. We denote the cost of access $\\sigma_i$ by $c_i$ for move-to-front and by $c_i^*$ for heuristic $\\text H$. Suppose that heuristic $\\text H$ performs $t_i^*$ transpositions during access $\\sigma_i$.</p> <p>c. In part (b), you showed that $c_i = 2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) - 1$. Now show that $c_i^* = \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}^*}(x) + t_i^*$.</p> <p>We define an inversion in list $L_i$ as a pair of elements $y$ and $z$ such that $y$ precedes $z$ in $L_i$ and $z$ precedes $y$ in list $L_i^*$. Suppose that list $L_i$ has $q_i$ inversions after processing the access sequence $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_i \\rangle$. Then, we define a potential function $\\Phi$ that maps $L_i$ to a real number by $\\Phi(L_i) = 2q_i$. For example, if $L_i$ has the elements $\\langle e, c, a, d, b \\rangle$ and $L_i^*$ has the elements $\\langle c, a, b, d, e \\rangle$, then $L_i$ has 5 inversions $((e, c), (e, a), (e, d), (e, b), (d, b))$, and so $\\Phi(L_i) = 10$. Observe that $\\Phi(L_i) \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and that, if move-to-front and heuristic $\\text H$ start with the same list $L_0$, then $\\Phi(L_0) = 0$.</p> <p>d. Argue that a transposition either increases the potential by $2$ or decreases the potential by $2$.</p> <p>Suppose that access $\\sigma_i$ finds the element $x$. To understand how the potential changes due to $\\sigma_i$, let us partition the elements other than $x$ into four sets, depending on where they are in the lists just before the $i$th access:</p> <ul> <li>Set $A$ consists of elements that precede $x$ in both $L_{i - 1}$ and $L_{i - 1}^*$.</li> <li>Set $B$ consists of elements that precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$ and follow $x$ in $L_{i - 1}^*$.</li> <li>Set $C$ consists of elements that follow $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$ and precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}^*$.</li> <li>Set $D$ consists of elements that follow $x$ in both $L_{i - 1}$ and $L_{i - 1}^*$.</li> </ul> <p>e. Argue that $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) = |A| + |B| + 1$ and $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}^*}(x) = |A| + |C| + 1$.</p> <p>f. Show that access $\\sigma_i$ causes a change in potential of</p> <p>$$\\Phi(L_i) - \\Phi(L_{i - 1}) \\le 2(|A| - |B| + t_i^*),$$</p> <p>where, as before, heuristic $\\text H$ performs $t_i^*$ transpositions during access $\\sigma_i$.</p> <p>Define the amortized cost $\\hat c_i$ of access $\\sigma_i$ by $\\hat c_i = c_i + \\Phi(L_i) - \\Phi(L_{i - 1})$.</p> <p>g. Show that the amortized cost $\\hat c_i$ of access $\\sigma_i$ is bounded from above by $4c_i^*$.</p> <p>h. Conclude that the cost $C_{\\text{MTF}}(\\sigma)$ of access sequence $\\sigma$ with move-to-front is at most $4$ times the cost $C_H(\\sigma)$ of $\\sigma$ withany other heuristic $\\text H$, assuming that both heuristics start with the same list.</p> <p>a. Since the heuristic is picked in advance, given any sequence of requests given so far, we can simulate what ordering the heuristic will call for, then, we will pick our next request to be whatever element will of been in the last position of the list. Continuing until all the requests have been made, we have that the cost of this sequence of accesses is $= mn$.</p> <p>b. The cost of finding an element is $= \\text{rank}_L(x)$ and since it needs to be swapped with all the elements before it, of which there are $\\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$, the total cost is $2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$.</p> <p>c. Regardless of the heuristic used, we first need to locate the element, which is left where ever it was after the previous step, so, needs $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x)$. After that, by definition, there are $t_i$ transpositions made, so, $c^*_i = \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) + t_i^*$.</p> <p>d. If we perform a transposition of elements $y$ and $z$, where $y$ is towards the left. Then there are two cases. The first is that the final ordering of the list in $L_i^*$ is with $y$ in front of $z$, in which case we have just increased the number of inversions by $1$, so the potential increases by $2$. The second is that in $L_I^*z$ occurs before $y$, in which case, we have just reduced the number of inversions by one, reducing the potential by $2$.</p> <p>In both cases, whether or not there is an inversion between $y$ or $z$ and any other element has not changed, since the transposition only changed the relative ordering of those two elements.</p> <p>e. By definition, $A$ and $B$ are the only two of the four categories to place elements that precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$, since there are $|A| + |B|$ elements preceding it, it's rank in $L_{i - 1}$ is $|A| + |B| + 1$. Similarly, the two categories in which an element can be if it precedes $x$ in $L^*_{i - 1}$ are $A$ and $C$, so, in $L^*_{i - 1}$, $x$ has $\\text{rank} |A| + |C| + 1$.</p> <p>f. We have from part d that the potential increases by $2$ if we transpose two elements that are being swapped so that their relative order in the final ordering is being screwed up, and decreases by two if they are begin placed into their correct order in $L^*_i$.</p> <p>In particular, they increase it by at most $2$, since we are keeping track of the number of inversions that may not be the direct effect of the transpositions that heuristic $H$ made, we see which ones the Move to front heuristic may of added. In particular, since the move to front heuristic only changed the relative order of $x$ with respect to the other elements, moving it in front of the elements that preceded it in $L_{i - 1}$, we only care about sets $A$ and $B$. For an element in $A$, moving it to be behind $A$ created an inversion, since that element preceded $x$ in $L^*_i$. However, if the element were in $B$, we are removing an inversion by placing $x$ in front of it.</p> <p>g.</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat c_i &amp; \\le 2(|A| + |B| + 1) - 1 + 2(|A| - |B| + t_i^*) \\\\          &amp; =   4|A| + 1 + 2 t_i^* \\\\          &amp; \\le 4(|A| + |C| + 1 + t_i^*) \\\\          &amp; =   4 c_i^*. \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>h. We showed that the amortized cost of each operation under the move to front heuristic was at most four times the cost of the operation using any other heuristic. Since the amortized cost added up over all these operation is at most the total (real) cost, so we have that the total cost with movetofront is at most four times the total cost with an arbitrary other heuristic.</p>"},{"location":"Chap18/18.1/","title":"18.1 Definition of B-trees","text":""},{"location":"Chap18/18.1/#181-1","title":"18.1-1","text":"<p>Why don't we allow a minimum degree of $t = 1$?</p> <p>According to the definition, minimum degree $t$ means every node other than the root must have at least $t - 1$ keys, and every internal node other than the root thus has at least $t$ children.

We need not write back the page, since it was not modified.</p> <p>Because disk operations are relatively expensive, we count two costs for any implementation: the total number of disk accesses and the total CPU time.

If we make a sequence of pushes until it just spills over onto the second page, then alternate popping and pulling many times, the asymptotic number of disk accesses and CPU time is of the same order as in part a.

Also, as we do a stack operation we either increase or decrease the potential by one. For us to have to load a new page from disk and write an old one to disk, we would need to be at least $m$ positions away from the most recently visited multiple of $m$, because we would have had to just cross a page boundary.

For deletion the situation is even simple. The only time the height changes is when the root has a single node and it is merged with its subtree nodes, leaving an empty root node to be deleted. In this case, we update the height of the new node to be the (old) height of the root minus $1$.</p> <p>b. Without loss of generality, assume $h' \\ge h''$.

Suppose that we were to implement only the mergeable-heap operations on a Fibonacci heap (i.e., we do not implement the $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ or $\\text{DELETE}$ operations). How would the trees in a Fibonacci heap resemble those in a binomial heap? How would they differ? Show that the maximum degree in an $n$-node Fibonacci heap would be at most $\\lfloor \\lg n\\rfloor$.</p> <p>e. Professor McGee has devised a new data structure based on Fibonacci heaps. A McGee heap has the same structure as a Fibonacci heap and supports just the mergeable-heap operations. The implementations of the operations are the same as for Fibonacci heaps, except that insertion and union consolidate the root list as their last step. What are the worst-case running times of operations on McGee heaps?</p> <p>a.</p> <ol> <li>$B_k$ consists of two binomial trees $B_{k - 1}$.</li> <li>The height of one $B_{k - 1}$ is increased by $1$.</li> <li>For $i = 0$, $\\binom{k}{0} = 1$ and only root is at depth $0$. Suppose in $B_{k - 1}$, the number of nodes at depth $i$ is $\\binom{k - 1}{i}$, in $B_k$, the number of nodes at depth $i$ is $\\binom{k - 1}{i} + \\binom{k - 1}{i - 1} = \\binom{k}{i}$.</li> <li>The degree of the root increase by $1$.</li> </ol> <p>b. Let $n.b$ denote the binary expansion of $n$. The fact that we can have at most one of each binomial tree corresponds to the fact that we can have at most $1$ as any digit of $n.b$. Since each binomial tree has a size which is a power of $2$, the binomial trees required to represent n nodes are uniquely determined. We include $B_k$ if and only if the $k$th position of $n.b$ is $1$. Since the binary representation of $n$ has at most $\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor+ 1$ digits, this also bounds the number of trees which can be used to represent $n$ nodes.</p> <p>c. Given a node $x$, let $x.key$, $x.p$, $x.c$, and $x.s$ represent the attributes key, parent, left-most child, and sibling to the right, respectively. The pointer attributes have value $\\text{NIL}$ when no such node exists. The root list will be stored in a singly linked list.</p> <ul> <li>MAKE-HEAP initialize an empty list for the root list and return a pointer to the head of the list, which contains $\\text{NIL}$. This takes constant time. To insert: Let $x$ be a node with key $k$, to be inserted. Scan the root list to find the first $m$ such that $B_m$ is not one of the trees in the binomial heap. If there is no $B_0$, simply create a single root node $x$. Otherwise, union $x, B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_{m - 1}$ into a $B_m$ tree. Remove all root nodes of the unioned trees from the root list, and update it with the new root. Since each join operation is logarithmic in the height of the tree, the total time is $O(\\lg n)$. $\\text{MINIMUM}$ just scans the root list and returns the minimum in $O(\\lg n)$, since the root list has size at most $O(\\lg n)$.</li> <li>EXTRACT-MIN: finds and deletes the minimum, then splits the tree Bm which contained the minimum into its component binomial trees $B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_{m - 1}$ in $O(\\lg n)$ time. Finally, it unions each of these with any existing trees of the same size in $O(\\lg n)$ time.</li> <li>UNION: suppose we have two binomial heaps consisting of trees $B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, \\ldots, B_{i_k}$ and $B_{j_1}, B_{j_2}, \\ldots, B_{j_m}$ respectively. Simply union orresponding trees of the same size between the two heaps, then do another check and join any newly created trees which have caused additional duplicates. Note: we will perform at most one union on any fixed size of binomial tree so the total running time is still logarithmic in $n$, where we assume that $n$ is sum of the sizes of the trees which we are unioning.</li> <li>DECREASE-KEY: simply swap the node whose key was decreased up the tree until it satisfies the min-heap property. This method requires that we swap the node with its parent along with all their satellite data in a brute-force manner to avoid updating $p$ attributes of the siblings of the node. When the data stored in each node is large, we may want to update $p$ instead, which, however, will increase the running time bound to $O(\\lg^2 n)$.</li> <li>DELETE: note that every binomial tree consists of two copies of a smaller binomial tree, so we can write the procedure recursively. If the tree is a single node, simply delete it. If we wish to delete from $B_k$, first split the tree into its constituent copies of $B_{k - 1}$, and recursively call delete on the copy of $B_{k - 1}$ which contains $x$. If this results in two binomial trees of the same size, simply union them.</li> </ul> <p>d. The Fibonacci heap will look like a binomial heap, except that multiple copies of a given binomial tree will be allowed. Since the only trees which will appear are binomial trees and $B_k$ has $2k$ nodes, we must have $2k \\le n$, which implies $k \\le \\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor$. Since the largest root of any binomial tree occurs at the root, and on $B_k$ it is degree $k$, this also bounds the largest degree of a node.</p> <p>e. $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{UNION}$ will no longer have amortized $O(1)$ running time because $\\text{CONSOLIDATE}$ has runtime $O(\\lg n)$. Even if no nodes are consolidated, the runtime is dominated by the check that all degrees are distinct.</p> <p>Since calling $\\text{UNION}$ on a heap and a single node is the same as insertion, it must also have runtime $O(\\lg n)$. The other operations remain unchanged.</p>"},{"location":"Chap19/Problems/19-3/","title":"19-3 More Fibonacci-heap operations","text":"<p>We wish to augment a Fibonacci heap $H$ to support two new operations without changing the amortized running time of any other Fibonacci-heap operations.</p> <p>a.

In this problem, we shall implement 2-3-4 heaps, which support the mergeable-heap operations.</p> <p>The 2-3-4 heaps differ from 2-3-4 trees in the following ways. In 2-3-4 heaps, only leaves store keys, and each leaf $x$ stores exactly one key in the attribute $x.key$. The keys in the leaves may appear in any order. Each internal node $x$ contains a value $x.small$ that is equal to the smallest key stored in any leaf in the subtree rooted at $x$. The root $r$ contains an attribute $r.height$ that gives the height of the tree. Finally, 2-3-4 heaps are designed to be kept in main memory, so that disk reads and writes are not needed.</p> <p>Implement the following 2-3-4 heap operations. In parts (a)\u2013(e), each operation should run in $O(\\lg n)$ time on a 2-3-4 heap with $n$ elements.

Traverse a path from root to leaf as follows: At a given node, examine the attribute $x.small$ in each child-node of the current node. Proceed to the child node which minimizes this attribute. If the children of the current node are leaves, then simply return a pointer to the child node with smallest key. Since the height of the tree is $O(\\lg n)$ and the number of children of any node is at most $4$, this has runtime $O(\\lg n)$.</p> <p>b. Decrease the key of $x$, then traverse the simple path from $x$ to the root by following the parent pointers. At each node $y$ encountered, check the attribute $y.small$. If $k &lt; y.small$, set $y.small = k$. Otherwise do nothing and continue on the path.</p> <p>c. Insert works the same as in a B-tree, except that at each node it is assumed that the node to be inserted is 'smaller' than every key stored at that node, so the runtime is inherited.

As with $\\text{B-TREE-DELETE}$, we'll want to ensure that the tree satisfies the properties of being a 2-3-4 tree after deletion, so we'll need to check that we're never deleting a leaf which only has a single sibling.

Modify the $\\text{VEB-TREE-INSERT}$ procedure to produce pseudocode for the procedure $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-INSERT}(V, x)$, which inserts $x$ into the RS-vEB tree $V$, calling $\\text{CREATE-NEW-RS-VEB-TREE}$ as appropriate.</p> <p>d. Modify the $\\text{VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ procedure to produce pseudocode for the procedure $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}(V, x)$, which returns the successor of $x$ in RS-vEB tree $V$, or $\\text{NIL}$ if $x$ has no successor in $V$.</p> <p>e. Prove that, under the assumption of simple uniform hashing, your $\\text{RS-VEBTREE-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ procedures run in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ expected time.</p> <p>f. Assuming that elements are never deleted from a vEB tree, prove that the space requirement for the RS-vEB tree structure is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements actually stored in the RS-vEB tree.</p> <p>g. RS-vEB trees have another advantage over vEB trees: they require less time to create. How long does it take to create an empty RS-vEB tree?</p> <p>a. Lets look at what has to be stored for a vEB tree. Each vEB tree contains one vEB tree of size $\\sqrt[+]u$ and $\\sqrt[+]u$ vEB trees of size $\\sqrt[1]u$. It also is storing three numbers each of order $O(u)$, so they need $\\Theta(\\lg(u))$ space each. Lastly, it needs to store $\\sqrt u$ many pointers to the cluster vEB trees. We'll combine these last two contributions which are $\\Theta(\\lg(u))$ and $\\Theta(\\sqrt u)$ respectively into a single term that is $\\Theta(\\sqrt u)$. This gets us the recurrence</p> <p>$$P(u) = P(\\sqrt[+]u) + \\sqrt[+]u P(\\sqrt[-]u) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u).$$</p> <p>Then, we have that $u = 2^{2m}$ (which follows from the assumption that $\\sqrt u$ was an integer), this equation becomes</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} P(u) &amp; = (1 + 2^m)P(2^m) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u) \\\\      &amp; = (1 + \\sqrt u)P(\\sqrt u) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u) \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>as desired.</p> <p>b. We recall from our solution to problem 3-6.e (it seems like so long ago now) that given a number $n$, a bound on the number of times that we need to take the squareroot of a number before it falls below $2$ is $\\lg\\lg n$. So, if we just unroll out recurrence, we get that</p> <p>$$P(u) \\le \\Big(\\prod_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u}(u^{1 / 2^i} + 1) \\Big) P(2) + \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u} \\Theta(u^{1 / 2^i})(u^{1 / 2i} + 1).$$</p> <p>The first product has a highest power of $u$ corresponding to always multiplying the first terms of each binomial. The power in this term is equal to $\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u}$ which is a partial sum of a geometric series whose sum is $1$. This means that the first term is $o(u)$. The order of the ith term in the summation appearing in the formula is $u^{2 / 2^i}$. In particular, for $i = 1$ is it $O(u)$, and for any $i &gt; 1$, we have that $2 / 2^i &lt; 1$, so those terms will be $o(u)$. Putting it all together, the largest term appearing is $O(u)$, and so, $P(u)$ is $O(u)$.</p> <p>c. For this problem we just use the version written for normal vEB trees, with minor modifications. That is, since there are entries in cluster that may not exist, and summary may of not yet been initialized, just before we try to access either, we check to see if it's initialized. If it isn't, we do so then.</p> <p>d. As in the previous problem, we just wait until just before either of the two things that may of not been allocated try to get used then allocate them if need be.</p> <p>e. Since the initialization performed only take constant time, those modifications don't ruin the the desired runtime bound for the original algorithms already had. So, our responses to parts (c) and (d) are $O(\\lg\\lg n)$.</p> <p>f. As mentioned in the errata, this part should instead be changed to $O(n\\lg n)$ space. When we are adding an element, we may have to add an entry to a dynamic hash table, which means that a constant amount of extra space would be needed. If we are adding an element to that table, we also have to add an element to the RS-vEB tree in the summary, but the entry that we add in the cluster will be a constant size RS-vEB tree. We can charge the cost of that addition to the summary table to the making the minimum element entry that we added in the cluster table. Since we are always making at least one element be added as a new min entry somewhere, this amortization will mean that it is only a constant amount of time in order to store the new entry.</p> <p>g. It only takes a constant amount of time to create an empty RS-vEB tree. This is immediate since the only dependence on $u$ in $\\text{CREATE-NEW-RSvEB-TREE}(u)$ is on line 2 when $V.u$ is initialized, but this only takes a constant amount of time. Since nothing else in the procedure depends on $u$, it must take a constant amount of time.</p>"},{"location":"Chap20/Problems/20-2/","title":"20-2 $y$-fast tries","text":"<p>This problem investigates D. Willard's \"$y$-fast tries\" which, like van Emde Boas trees, perform each of the operations $\\text{MEMBER}$, $\\text{MINIMUM}$, $\\text{MAXIMUM}$, $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$, and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ on elements drawn from a universe with size $u$ in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ worst-case time. The $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations take $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ amortized time. Like reduced-space van Emde Boas trees (see Problem 20-1), $y$-fast tries use only $O(n)$ space to store $n$ elements. The design of $y$-fast tries relies on perfect hashing (see Section 11.5).</p> <p>As a preliminary structure, suppose that we create a perfect hash table containing not only every element in the dynamic set, but every prefix of the binary representation of every element in the set. For example, if $u = 16$, so that $\\lg u = 4$, and $x = 13$ is in the set, then because the binary representation of $13$ is $1101$, the perfect hash table would contain the strings $1$, $11$, $110$, and $1101$. In addition to the hash table, we create a doubly linked list of the elements currently in the set, in increasing order.</p> <p>a. How much space does this structure require?</p> <p>b. Show how to perform the $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ operations in $O(1)$ time; the $\\text{MEMBER}$, $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$, and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time; and the $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations in $O(\\lg u)$ time.</p> <p>To reduce the space requirement to $O(n)$, we make the following changes to the data structure:</p> <ul> <li>We cluster the $n$ elements into $n / \\lg u$ groups of size $\\lg u$. (Assume for now that $\\lg u$ divides $n$.) The first group consists of the $\\lg u$ smallest elements in the set, the second group consists of the next $\\lg u$ smallest elements, and so on.</li> <li>We designate a \"representative\" value for each group. The representative of the $i$th group is at least as large as the largest element in the $i$th group, and it is smaller than every element of the $(i + 1)$st group. (The representative of the last group can be the maximum possible element $u - 1$.) Note that a representative might be a value not currently in the set.</li> <li>We store the $\\lg u$ elements of each group in a balanced binary search tree, such as a red-black tree. Each representative points to the balanced binary search tree for its group, and each balanced binary search tree points to its group's representative.</li> </ul> <p>The perfect hash table stores only the representatives, which are also stored in a doubly linked list in increasing order.</p> <p>We call this structure a $y$-fast trie.</p> <p>c. Show that a $y$-fast trie requires only $O(n)$ space to store $n$ elements.</p> <p>d. Show how to perform the $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time with a $y$-fast trie.</p> <p>e. Show how to perform the $\\text{MEMBER}$ operation in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.</p> <p>f. Show how to perform the $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.</p> <p>g. Explain why the $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations take $\\Omega(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.</p> <p>h. Show how to relax the requirement that each group in a $y$-fast trie has exactly $\\lg u$ elements to allow $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ to run in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ amortized time without affecting the asymptotic running times of the other operations.</p> <p>a. By 11.5, the perfect hash table uses $O(m)$ space to store m elements. In a universe of size $u$, each element contributes $\\lg u$ entries to the hash table, so the requirement is $O(n\\lg u)$. Since the linked list requires $O(n)$, the total space requirement is $O(n\\lg u)$.</p> <p>b. $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ are easy. We just examine the first and last elements of the associated doubly linked list. $\\text{MEMBER}$ can actually be performed in $O(1)$, since we are simply checking membership in a perfect hash table. $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ are a bit more complicated.</p> <p>Assume that we have a binary tree in which we store all the elements and their prefixes. When we query the hash table for an element, we get a pointer to that element's location in the binary search tree, if the element is in the tree, and $\\text{NIL}$ otherwise. Moreover, assume that every leaf node comes with a pointer to its position in the doubly linked list. Let $x$ be the number whose successor we seek. Begin by performing a binary search of the prefixes in the hash table to find the longest hashed prefix $y$ which matches a prefix of $x$. This takes $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ since we can check if any prefix is in the hash table in $O(1)$.</p> <p>Observe that $y$ can have at most one child in the BST, because if it had both children then one of these would share a longer prefix with $x$. If the left child is missing, have the left child pointer point to the largest labeled leaf node in the BST which is less than $y$. If the right child is missing, use its pointer to point to the successor of $y$. If $y$ is a leaf node then $y = x$, so we simply follow the pointer to $x$ in the doubly linked list, in $O(1)$, and its successor is the next element on the list. If $y$ is not a leaf node, we follow its predecessor or successor node, depending on which we need. This gives us $O(1)$ access to the proper element, so the total runtime is $O(\\lg\\lg u)$. $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ must take $O(\\lg u)$ since we need to insert one entry into the hash table for each of their bits and update the pointers.</p> <p>c. The doubly linked list has less than $n$ elements, while the binary search trees contains $n$ nodes, thus a $y$-fast trie requires $O(n)$ space.</p> <p>d. $\\text{MINIMUM}$: Find the minimum representative in the doubly linked list in $\\Theta(1)$, then find the minimum element in the binary search tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.</p> <p>e. Find the smallest representative greater than $k$ with binary searching in $\\Theta(\\lg\\lg u)$, find the element in the binary search tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.</p> <p>f. If we can find the largest representative greater than or equal to $x$, we can determine which binary tree contains the predecessor or successor of $x$. To do this, just call $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ or $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ on $x$ to locate the appropriate tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$. Since the tree has height $\\lg u$, we can find the predecessor or successor in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.</p> <p>g. Same as e, we need to find the cluster in $\\Theta(\\lg\\lg u)$, then the operations in the binary search tree takes $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.</p> <p>h. We can relax the requirements and only impose the condition that each group has at least $\\frac{1}{2}\\lg u$ elements and at most $2\\lg u$ elements.</p> <ul> <li>If a red-black tree is too big, we split it in half at the median.</li> <li>If a red-black tree is too small, we merge it with a neighboring tree.</li> <li>If this causes the merged tree to become too large, we split it at the median.</li> <li>If a tree splits, we create a new representative.</li> <li>If two trees merge, we delete the lost representative.</li> </ul> <p>Any split or merge takes $O(\\lg u)$ since we have to insert or delete an element in the data structure storing our representatives, which by part (b) takes $O(\\lg u)$.</p> <p>However, we only split a tree after at least $\\lg u$ insertions, since the size of one of the red-black trees needs to increase from $\\lg u$ to $2\\lg u$ and we only merge two trees after at least $(1 / 2)\\lg u$ deletions, because the size of the merging tree needs to have decreased from $\\lg u$ to $(1 / 2)\\lg u$. Thus, the amortized cost of the merges, splits, and updates to representatives is $O(1)$ per insertion or deletion, so the amortized cost is $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ as desired.</p>"},{"location":"Chap21/21.1/","title":"21.1 Disjoint-set operations","text":""},{"location":"Chap21/21.1/#211-1","title":"21.1-1","text":"<p>Suppose that $\\text{CONNECTED-COMPONENTS}$ is run on the undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = \\{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k\\}$ and the edges of $E$ are processed in the order $(d, i)$, $(f, k)$, $(g, i)$, $(b, g)$, $(a, h)$, $(i, j)$, $(d, k)$, $(b, j)$, $(d, f)$, $(g, j)$, $(a, e)$.

After line 4, there are now $d + 2$ disjoint sets, so, line 5 brings it back down to $d + 1$ disjoint sets for the subsequent times through the loop. After the loop, there are no more changes to the number of disjoint sets, so, the algorithm terminates with $\\text{d + 1}$ disjoint sets, as desired.

First suppose the root $r$ of $G_\\pi$ is an articulation point. Then the removal of $r$ from $G$ would cause the graph to disconnect, so $r$ has at least $2$ children in $G$. If $r$ has only one child $v$ in $G_\\pi$ then it must be the case that there is a path from $v$ to each of $r$'s other children. Since removing $r$ disconnects the graph, there must exist vertices $u$ and $w$ such that the only paths from $u$ to $w$ contain $r$.</p> <p>To reach $r$ from $u$, the path must first reach one of $r$'s children. This child is connect to $v$ via a path which doesn't contain $r$.</p> <p>To reach $w$, the path must also leave $r$ through one of its children, which is also reachable by $v$. This implies that there is a path from $u$ to $w$ which doesn't contain $r$, a contradiction.</p> <p>Now suppose $r$ has at least two children $u$ and $v$ in $G_\\pi$. Then there is no path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ which doesn't go through $r$, since otherwise $u$ would be an ancestor of $v$. Thus, removing $r$ disconnects the component containing $u$ and the component containing $v$, so $r$ is an articulation point.</p> <p>b. Suppose that $v$ is a nonroot vertex of $G_\\pi$ and that $v$ has a child $s$ such that neither $s$ nor any of $s$'s descendants have back edges to a proper ancestor of $v$. Let $r$ be an ancestor of $v$, and remove $v$ from $G$. Since we are in the undirected case, the only edges in the graph are tree edges or back edges, which means that every edge incident with $s$ takes us to a descendant of $s$, and no descendants have back edges, so at no point can we move up the tree by taking edges. Therefore $r$ is unreachable from $s$, so the graph is disconnected and $v$ is an articulation point.</p> <p>Now suppose that for every child of $v$ there exists a descendant of that child which has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$. Remove $v$ from $G$. Every subtree of $v$ is a connected component. Within a given subtree, find the vertex which has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$. Since the set $T$ of vertices which aren't descendants of $v$ form a connected component, we have that every subtree of $v$ is connected to $T$. Thus, the graph remains connected after the deletion of $v$ so $v$ is not an articulation point.</p> <p>c. Since $v$ is discovered before all of its descendants, the only back edges which could affect $v.low$ are ones which go from a descendant of $v$ to a proper ancestor of $v$. If we know $u.low$ for every child $u$ of $v$, then we can compute $v.low$ easily since all the information is coded in its descendants.</p> <p>Thus, we can write the algorithm recursively: If $v$ is a leaf in $G_\\pi$ then $v.low$ is the minimum of $v.d$ and $w.d$ where $(v, w)$ is a back edge. If $v$ is not a leaf, $v$ is the minimum of $v.d$, $w.d$ where $(v, w)$ is a back edge, and $u.low$, where $u$ is a child of $v$. Computing $v.low$ for a vertex is linear in its degree. The sum of the vertices' degrees gives twice the number of edges, so the total runtime is $O(E)$.</p> <p>d. First apply the algorithm of part (c) in $O(E)$ to compute $v.low$ for all $v \\in V$. If $v.low$ = $v.d$ if and only if no descendant of $v$ has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$, if and only if $v$ is not an articulation point.</p> <p>Thus, we need only check $v.low$ versus $v.d$ to decide in constant time whether or not $v$ is an articulation point, so the runtime is $O(E)$.</p> <p>e. An edge $(u, v)$ lies on a simple cycle if and only if there exists at least one path from $u$ to $v$ which doesn't contain the edge $(u, v)$, if and only if removing $(u, v)$ doesn't disconnect the graph, if and only if $(u, v)$ is not a bridge.</p> <p>f. A edge $(u, v)$ lies on a simple cycle in an undirected graph if and only if either both of its endpoints are articulation points, or one of its endpoints is an articulation point and the other is a vertex of degree $1$. There's also a special case where there's only one edge whose incident vertices are both degree $1$. We can check this case in constant time. Since we can compute all articulation points in $O(E)$ and we can decide whether or not a vertex has degree $1$ in constant time, we can run the algorithm in part (d) and then decide whether each edge is a bridge in constant time, so we can find all bridges in $O(E)$ time.</p> <p>g. It is clear that every nonbridge edge is in some biconnected component, so we need to show that if $C_1$ and $C_2$ are distinct biconnected components, then they contain no common edges.

First, we'll show that it is necessary to have in degree equal out degree for each vertex. Suppose that there was some vertex v for which the two were not equal, suppose that $\\text{in-degree}(v) - \\text{out-degree}(v)$. Note that we may assume that in degree is greater because otherwise we would just look at the transpose graph in which we traverse the cycle backwards. If $v$ is the start of the cycle as it is listed, just shift the starting and ending vertex to any other one on the cycle. Then, in whatever cycle we take going though $v$, we must pass through $v$ some number of times, in particular, after we pass through it a times, the number of unused edges coming out of $v$ is zero, however, there are still unused edges goin in that we need to use. This means that there is no hope of using those while still being a tour, becase we would never be able to escape $v$ and get back to the vertex where the tour started. Now, we show that it is sufficient to have the in degree and out degree equal for every vertex. To do this, we will generalize the problem slightly so that it is more amenable to an inductive approach. That is, we will show that for every graph $G$ that has two vertices $v$ and $u$ so that all the vertices have the same in and out degree except that the indegree is one greater for $u$ and the out degree is one greater for $v$, then there is an Euler path from $v$ to $u$. This clearly lines up with the original statement if we pick $u = v$ to be any vertex in the graph. We now perform induction on the number of edges. If there is only a single edge, then taking just that edge is an Euler tour. Then, suppose that we start at $v$ and take any edge coming out of it.

Call the edge that is selected for that cut for the second best minimum spanning tree $(x, y)$.

Then, we have that if consider $T - \\{(u, v)\\} \\cup \\{(x, y)\\}$, it will be a second best minimum spanning tree. This is because if the second best minimum spanning tree also selected a non-light edge for another cut, it would end up more expensive than all the minimum spanning trees.

If we can find $x$ in constant time, then we will have the whole dynamic program running in time $O(V^2)$, since that's the size of the table that's being built up. To find $x$ in constant time, we preprocess the tree. We first pick an arbitrary root. Then, we do the preprocessing for Tarjan's off-line least common ancestors algorithm (See problem 21-3). This takes time just a little more than linear, $O(|V|\\alpha(|V|))$. Once we've computed all the least common ancestors, we can just look up that result at some point later in constant time. Then, to find the $w$ that we should pick, we first see if $u = \\text{LCA}(u, v)$ if it does not, then we just pick the parent of $u$ in the tree.

Then, we take a running minimum over all pairs of vertices $u$, $v$, of the value of $w(u, v) - \\max[u, v]$. If there is no edge between $u$ and $v$, we think of the weight being infinite.

($\\textit{Hint:}$ You may want to use a subroutine that contracts sets of edges, as in the $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$ procedure described in Problem 23-2.)</p> <p>a. To see that every minimum spanning tree is also a bottleneck spanning tree. Suppose that $T$ is a minimum spanning tree. Suppose there is some edge in it $(u, v)$ that has a weight that's greater than the weight of the bottleneck spanning tree. Then, let $V_1$ be the subset of vertices of $V$ that are reachable from $u$ in $T$, without going though $v$. Define $V_2$ symmetrically. Then, consider the cut that separates $V_1$ from $V_2$. The only edge that we could add across this cut is the one of minimum weight, so we know that there are no edge across this cut of weight less than $w(u, v)$.</p> <p>However, we have that there is a bottleneck spanning tree with less than that weight. This is a contradiction because a bottleneck spanning tree, since it is a spanning tree, must have an edge across this cut.</p> <p>b. To do this, we first process the entire graph, and remove any edges that have weight greater than $b$. If the remaining graph is connected, we can just arbitrarily select any tree in it, and it will be a bottleneck spanning tree of weight at most $b$. Testing connectivity of a graph can be done in linear time by running a breadth first search and then making sure that no vertices remain white at the end.</p> <p>c. Write down all of the edge weights of vertices. Use the algorithm from section 9.3 to find the median of this list of numbers in time $O(E)$. Then, run the procedure from part b with this median value as input. Then there are two cases:</p> <p>First, we could have that there is a bottleneck spanning tree with weight at most this median. Then just throw away the edges with weight more than the median, and repeat the procedure on this new graph with half the edges.</p> <p>Second, we could have that there is no bottleneck spanning tree with at most that weight. Then, we should run a procedure similar to problem 23-2 to contract all of the edges that have weight at most the weight of the median. This takes time $O(E)$ and then we are left solving the problem on a graph that now has half the edges.</p> <p>Observe that both cases are $O(E)$ and each recursion reduces the problem size into half. The solution to this recurrence is therefore linear.</p>"},{"location":"Chap23/Problems/23-4/","title":"23-4 Alternative minimum-spanning-tree algorithms","text":"<p>In this problem, we give pseudocode for three different algorithms.

This does return an $\\text{MST}$. To see this, we'll show that we never remove an edge which must be part of a minimum spanning tree. If we remove $e$, then $e$ cannot be a bridge, which means that e lies on a simple cycle of the graph. Since we remove edges in nonincreasing order, the weight of every edge on the cycle must be less than or equal to that of $e$. By exercise 23.1-5, there is a minimum spanning tree on $G$ with edge $e$ removed.</p> <p>To implement this, we begin by sorting the edges in $O(E \\lg E)$ time. For each edge we need to check whether or not $T - {e}$ is connected, so we'll need to run a $\\text{DFS}$. Each one takes $O(V + E)$, so doing this for all edges takes $O(E(V + E))$. This dominates the running time, so the total time is $O(E^2)$.</p> <p>b. This doesn't return an $\\text{MST}$. To see this, let $G$ be the graph on 3 vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the eges be $(a, b)$, $(b, c)$, and $(c, a)$ with weights $3, 2$, and $1$ respectively. If the algorithm examines the edges in their order listed, it will take the two heaviest edges instead of the two lightest.</p> <p>An efficient implementation will use disjoint sets to keep track of connected components, as in $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$ in problem 23-2. Trying to union within the same component will create a cycle. Since we make $|V|$ calls to $\\text{MAKESET}$ and at most $3|E|$ calls to $\\text{FIND-SET}$ and $\\text{UNION}$, the runtime is $O(E\\alpha(V))$.</p> <p>c. This does return an $\\text{MST}$. To see this, we simply quote the result from exercise 23.1-5. The only edges we remove are the edges of maximum weight on some cycle, and there always exists a minimum spanning tree which doesn't include these edges. Moreover, if we remove an edge from every cycle then the resulting graph cannot have any cycles, so it must be a tree.</p> <p>To implement this, we use the approach taken in part (b), except now we also need to find the maximum weight edge on a cycle. For each edge which introduces a cycle we can perform a $\\text{DFS}$ to find the cycle and max weight edge. Since the tree at that time has at most one cycle, it has at most $|V|$ edges, so we can run $\\text{DFS}$ in $O(V)$.

To see that the existence of an arbitrage situation is equivalent to there being a negative weight cycle in the original graph, consider the following sequence of steps:</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} R[i_1, i_2] \u00b7 R[i_2, i_3] \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot R[i_k, i_1] &amp; &gt; 1 \\\\ \\ln(R[i_1, i_2]) + \\ln(R[i_2, i_3]) + \\cdots + \\ln(R[i_k, i_1]) &amp; &gt; 0 \\\\ \u2212\\ln(R[i_1, i_2]) \u2212 \\ln(R[i_2, i_3]) \u2212 \\cdots \u2212 \\ln(R[i_k, i_1]) &amp; &lt; 0. \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>b. To do this, we first perform the same modification of all the edge weights as done in part (a) of this problem. Then, we wish to detect the negative weight cycle. To do this, we relax all the edges $|V| \u2212 1$ many times, as in BellmanFord algorithm. Then, we record all of the $d$ values of the vertices. Then, we relax all the edges $|V|$ more times. Then, we check to see which vertices had their $d$ value decrease since we recorded them. All of these vertices must lie on some (possibly disjoint) set of negative weight cycles. Call $S$ this set of vertices. To find one of these cycles in particular, we can pick any vertex in $S$ and greedily keep picking any vertex that it has an edge to that is also in $S$. Then, we just keep an eye out for a repeat. This finds us our cycle. We know that we will never get to a dead end in this process because the set $S$ consists of vertices that are in some union of cycles, and so every vertex has out degree at least $1$.</p>"},{"location":"Chap24/Problems/24-4/","title":"24-4 Gabow's scaling algorithm for single-source shortest paths","text":"<p>A scaling algorithm solves a problem by initially considering only the highestorder bit of each relevant input value (such as an edge weight).

It progressively looks at more and more high-order bits, refining the solution each time, until it has examined all bits and computed the correct solution.</p> <p>In this problem, we examine an algorithm for computing the shortest paths from a single source by scaling edge weights. We are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with nonnegative integer edge weights $w$. Let $W = \\max_{(u, v) \\in E} \\{w(u, v)\\}$. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(E\\lg W)$ time. We assume that all vertices are reachable from the source.</p> <p>The algorithm uncovers the bits in the binary representation of the edge weights one at a time, from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Specifically, let $k = \\lceil \\lg(W + 1) \\rceil$ be the number of bits in the binary representation of $W$, and for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$, let $w_i(u, v) = \\lfloor w(u, v) / 2^{k - i} \\rfloor$. That is, $w_i(u, v)$ is the \"scaled-down\" version of $w(u, v)$ given by the $i$ most significant bits of $w(u, v)$. (Thus, $w_k(u, v) = w(u, v)$ for all $(u, v) \\in E$.) For example, if $k = 5$ and $w(u, v) = 25$, which has the binary representation $\\langle 11001 \\rangle$, then $w_3(u, v) = \\langle 110 \\rangle = 6$.

Note that there may also be cheapest path of longer length since we necessarily do have zero cost cycles. However, this isn't guaranteed since the zero cost cycle may not lie along a cheapest path from $s$ to $v$.</p> <p>c. Since the total cost of the cycle is $0$, and one part of it has cost $x$, in order to balance that out, the weight of the rest of the cycle has to be $-x$.

This gets us that $\\delta(s, v) \\le \\delta(s, u) + x$.</p> <p>To see the converse inequality, suppose that we have some shortest length path from $s$ to $v$. Then, we can traverse the cycle going from $v$ to $u$. We already said that this part of the cycle had total cost $-x$. This gets us that $\\delta(s, u) \\le \\delta(s, v) - x$. Or, rearranging, we have $\\delta(s, u) + x \\le \\delta(s, v)$. Since we have inequalities both ways, we must have equality.</p> <p>d. To see this, we find a vertex $v$ and natural number $k \\le n - 1$ so that $\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v) = 0$.

Since we did not change the $d$ value of $v$ after looking at length $n$ paths, by part (a), we know that there was some length of this path, say $k$, which had the same cost. That is, we have $\\delta_n(s, v) = \\delta_k(s,v)$.</p> <p>e. This is an immediate result of the previous problem and part (b). Part (a) says that the inequality holds for all $v$, so, we have</p> <p>$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta(s, v)}{n - k} \\ge 0.$$</p> <p>The previous part says that there is some $v$ on each minimum weight cycle so that</p> <p>$$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta(s, v)}{n - k} = 0,$$</p> <p>which means that</p> <p>$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v)}{n - k} \\le 0.$$</p> <p>Putting the two inequalities together, we have the desired equality.</p> <p>f. If we add $t$ to the weight of each edge, the mean weight of any cycle becomes</p> <p>$$\\mu(c) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i = 1}^k (w(e_i) + t) = \\frac{1}{k} \\Big(\\sum_i^k w(e_i) \\Big) + \\frac{kt}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\Big(\\sum_i^k w(e_i) \\Big) + t.$$</p> <p>This is the original, unmodified mean weight cycle, plus $t$. Since this is how the mean weight of every cycle is changed, the lowest mean weight cycle stays the lowest mean weight cycle. This means that $\\mu^*$ will increase by $t$. Suppose that we first compute $\\mu^*$. Then, we subtract from every edge weight the value $\\mu^*$. This will make the new $\\mu^*$ equal zero, which by part (e) means that</p> <p>$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v)}{n - k} = 0.$$</p> <p>Since they are both equal to zero, they are both equal to each other.</p> <p>g.

However, This means that $d_{il} \\le d_{ij} - w_{ij}$, which we can rearrange to get the desired inequality. We can just continue following this inequality around, and if we ever get some cycle, $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_c$, then we would have that $d_{ii_1} \\le d_{ii_1} + w_{i_1i_2} + w_{i_2i_3} + \\cdots + w_{i_ci_1}$. So, if we subtract the common term sfrom both sides, we get that $0 \\le w_{i_ci_1} + \\sum_{q = 1}^{c - 1} w_{i_qi_{q + 1}}$.

This will mean that every vertex in the component the edge is coming from will have an edge going to every vertex in the component that the edge is going to. So, the total number of edges after this operation will be $|V| / 2 + |V| / 4$ So, the number of edges increased by $|V| / 4$.

If we ever don't insert an edge when doing this, we can stop exploring that branch of the ancestor tree. Similarly, we keep doing this for all of the ancestors of $v$.

Then it becomes valid for it to send flow back to $v_2$ or to $v_3$. It considers $v_2$ first because of the ordering of its neighbor list. This means that $9$ units of flow are pushed back to $v_2$. Since $v_4.h$ increased, it moves to the front of the list Then, we consider $v_2$ since it is the only still overflowing vertex. We increase its height to $3$. Then, it is overflowing by $9$ so it increases its height to $3$ to send $9$ units to $v_4$. It's height increased so it goes to the of the list. Then, we consider $v_4$, which is overflowing. It pushes $7$ units to $v_3$. Since it is still overflowing by $2$, it increases its height to $4$ and pushes the rest back to $v_2$ and goes to the front of the list. Up next is $v_2$, which increases its height by $2$ to sends its overflow to $v_4$. The excess flow keeps bobbing around the four vertices, each time requiring them to increase their height a bit to discharge to a neighbor only to have that neighbor increase to discharge it back until $v_2$ has increased in height enough to send all of it's excess back to s. Last but not least, $v_3$ pushes its overflow of $7$ units to $t$, and gives us a maximum flow of $23$.</p>"},{"location":"Chap26/26.5/#265-2-star","title":"26.5-2 $\\star$","text":"<p>We would like to implement a push-relabel algorithm in which we maintain a firstin, first-out queue of overflowing vertices.

I claim that if $(x_i, y_j)$ has flow $1$ in the maximum flow and we set $(i, j)$ to be an edge in our path cover, then the result is a minimum path cover. First observe that no vertex appears twice in the same path. If it did, then we would have $f(x_i, y_j) = f(x_k, y_j)$ for some $i \\ne k \\ne j$. However, this contradicts the conservation of flow, since the capacity leaving $y_j$ is only $1$. Moreover, since the capacity from $s$ to $x_i$ is $1$, we can never have two edges of the form $(x_i, y_j)$ and $(x_i, y_k)$ for $k \\ne j$. We can ensure every vertex is included in some path by asserting that if there is no edge $(x_i, y_j)$ or $(x_j, y_i)$ for some $j$, then $j$ will be on a path by itself. Thus, we are guaranteed to obtain a path cover. If there are $k$ paths in a cover of $n$ vertices, then they will consist of $n \u2212 k$ edges in total. Given a path cover, we can recover a flow by assigning edge $(x_i, y_j)$ flow $1$ if and only if $(i, j)$ is an edge in one of the paths in the cover. Suppose that the maximum flow algorithm yields a cover with $k$ paths, and hence flow $n \u2212 k$, but a minimum path cover uses strictly fewer than $k$ paths. Then it must use strictly more than $n \u2212 k$ edges, so we can recover a flow which is larger than the one previously found, contradicting the fact that the previous flow was maximal. Thus, we find a minimum path cover. Since the maximum flow in the graph corresponds to finding a maximum matching in the bipartite graph obtained by considering the induced subgraph of $G'$ on $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, section 26.3 tells us that we can find a maximum flow in $O(V E)$.</p> <p>b.

This means that the capacity of the cut is infinite, a contradiction to the given fact that the cut was finite capacity.</p> <p>b. Though tempting, it doesn't suffice to just look at the experts that are on the $s$ side of the cut. To see why this doesn't work, imagine there's one specialized skill areal, such as \"Computer power switch operator\", that is required for every job. Then, any finite cut that would include any job getting done would requiring that this expert be hired. However, since there is an infinite capacity edge coming from him to every other job, then all of the experts need for all the other jobs would also need to be hired. So, if we have this obiquitously required employee, any minimum cut would have to be all or nothing, but it is trivial to find a counterexample to this being optimal.</p> <p>In order for this problem to be solvable, one must assume that for every expert you've hired, you do all of the jobs that he is required for.

If the cut was minimal than this must be a positive change, so the revenue isn't enough to justify the hire, meaning that those jobs that were on the source side in the minimal cut are exactly the jobs to attempt.</p> <p>c.

The number of edges in the flow network is $m + n + r$, and the number of vertices is $2 + m + n$, so the runtime is just $O((2 + m + n)^3)$, so it's cubic in $\\max(m, n)$.

Since the capacity of a path is equal to the minimum of the capacities of each of the edges along that path, we know that any edges in the residual network that have a capacity less than $K$ cannot be used in such an augmenting path.

We know that there are at most $|E|$ of them since they are a subset of the edges.

Given two matchings $M$ and $M^*$ in $G$, show that every vertex in the graph $G' = (V, M \\oplus M^*)$ has degree at most $2$. Conclude that $G'$ is a disjoint union of simple paths or cycles.

Let $A$ be the set of edges $(M \\oplus M') \\oplus P$. Show that $A = (P_1 \\cup P_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k) \\oplus P$ and that $|A| \\ge (k + 1)l$.

Prove that if a shortest augmenting path with respect to $M$ has $l$ edges, the size of the maximum matching is at most $|M| + |V| / (l + 1)$.</p> <p>f. Show that the number of repeat loop iterations in the algorithm is at most $2\\sqrt{|V|}$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ By how much can $M$ grow after iteration number $\\sqrt{|V|}$?)</p> <p>g. Give an algorithm that runs in $O(E)$ time to find a maximal set of vertexdisjoint shortest augmenting paths $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$ for a given matching $M$. Conclude that the total running time of $\\text{HOPCROFT-KARP}$ is $O(\\sqrt V E)$.</p> <p>a. Suppose $M$ is a matching and $P$ is an augmenting path with respect to $M$. Then $P$ consists of $k$ edges in $M$, and $k + 1$ edges not in $M$. This is because the first edge of $P$ touches an unmatched vertex in $L$, so it cannot be in $M$. Similarly, the last edge in $P$ touches an unmatched vertex in $R$, so the last edge cannot be in $M$. Since the edges alternate being in or not in $M$, there must be exactly one more edge not in $M$ than in $M$. This implies that</p> <p>$$|M \\oplus P| = |M| + |P| - 2k = |M| + 2k + 1 - 2k = |M| + 1,$$</p> <p>since we must remove each edge of $M$ which is in $P$ from both $M$ and $P$. Now suppose $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$ are vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. Let $k_i$ be the number of edges in $P_i$ which are in $M$, so that $|P_i| = 2k + i + 1$. Then we have</p> <p>$$M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup P_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k) = |M| + |P_1| + \\cdots + |P_k| - 2k_1 - 2k_2 - \\cdots - 2k_k = |M| + k.$$</p> <p>To see that we in fact get a matching, suppose that there was some vertex $v$ which had at least $2$ incident edges $e$ and $e'$. They cannot both come from $M$, since $M$ is a matching. They cannot both come from $P$ since $P$ is simple and every other edge of $P$ is removed. Thus, $e \\in M$ and $e' \\in P \\backslash M$. However, if $e \\in M$ then $e \\in P$, so $e \\notin M \\oplus P$, a contradiction. A similar argument gives the case of $M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k)$.</p> <p>b. Suppose some vertex in $G'$ has degree at least $3$. Since the edges of $G'$ come from $M \\oplus M^*$, at least $2$ of these edges come from the same matching. However, a matching never contains two edges with the same endpoint, so this is impossible. Thus every vertex has degree at most $2$, so $G'$ is a disjoint union of simple paths and cycles. If edge $(u, v)$ is followed by edge $(z, w)$ in a simple path or cycle then we must have $v = z$. Since two edges with the same endpoint cannot appear in a matching, they must belong alternately to $M$ and $M^*$. Since edges alternate, every cycle has the same number of edges in each matching and every path has at most one more edge in one matching than in the other. Thus, if $|M| \\le |M^*|$ there must be at least $|M^*| - |M|$ vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$.</p> <p>c. Every vertex matched by $M$ must be incident with some edge in $M'$. Since $P$ is augmenting with respect to $M$\u2032, the left endpoint of the first edge of $P$ isn't incident to a vertex touched by an edge in $M'$. In particular, $P$ starts at a vertex in $L$ which is unmatched by $M$ since every vertex of $M$ is incident with an edge in $M'$. Since $P$ is vertex disjoint from $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$, any edge of $P$ which is in $M'$ must in fact be in $M$ and any edge of $P$ which is not in $M'$ cannot be in $M$. Since $P$ has edges alternately in $M'$ and $E - M'$, $P$ must in fact have edges alternately in $M$ and $E - M$. Finally, the last edge of $P$ must be incident to a vertex in $R$ which is unmatched by $M'$. Any vertex unmatched by $M'$ is also unmatched by $M$, so $P$ is an augmenting path for $M$. $P$ must have length at least $l$ since $l$ is the length of the shortest augmenting path with respect to $M$. If $P$ had length exactly $l$, then this would contradict the fact that $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$ is a maximal set of vertex disjoint paths of length $l$ because we could add $P$ to the set. Thus $P$ has more than $l$ edges.</p> <p>d. Any edge in $M \\oplus M'$ is in exactly one of $M$ or $M'$. Thus, the only possible contributing edges from $M'$ are from $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$. An edge from $M$ can contribute if and only if it is not in exactly one of $M$ and $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$, which means it must be in both. Thus, the edges from $M$ are redundant so $M \\oplus M' = (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k)$ which implies $A = (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k) \\oplus P$.</p> <p>Now we'll show that $P$ is edge disjoint from each $P_i$. Suppose that an edge $e$ of $P$ is also an edge of $P_i$ for some $i$. Since $P$ is an augmenting path with respect to $M'$ either $e \\in M'$ or $e \\in E - M'$. Suppose $e \\in M'$. Since $P$ is also augmenting with respect to $M$, we must have $e \\in M$. However, if $e$ is in $M$ and $M'$, then $e$ cannot be in any of the $P_i$'s by the definition of $M'$. Now suppose $e \\in E - M'$. Then $e \\in E - M$ since $P$ is augmenting with respect to $M$. Since $e$ is an edge of $P_i$, $e \\in E - M'$ implies that $e \\in M$, a contradiction.</p> <p>Since $P$ has edges alternately in $M'$ and $E - M'$ and is edge disjoint from $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$, $P$ is also an augmenting path for $M$, which implies $|P| \\ge l$. Since every edge in $A$ is disjoint we conclude that $|A| \\ge (k + 1)l$.</p> <p>e. Suppose $M^*$ is a matching with strictly more than $|M| + |V| / (l + 1)$ edges. By part (b) there are strictly more than $|V| / (l + 1)$ vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. Each one of these contains at least $l$ edges, so it is incident on $l + 1$ vertices. Since the paths are vertex disjoint, there are strictly more than $|V|(l + 1) / (l + 1)$ distinct vertices incident with these paths, a contradiction. Thus, the size of the maximum matching is at most $|M| + |V| / (l + 1)$.</p> <p>f. Consider what happens after iteration number $\\sqrt{|V|}$. Let $M^*$ be a maximal matching in $G$. Then $|M^*| \\ge |M|$ so by part (b), $M \\oplus M^*$ contains at least $|M^*| - |M|$ vertex disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. By part (c), each of these is also a an augmenting path for $M$. Since each has length $\\sqrt{|V|}$, there can be at most $\\sqrt{|V|}$ such paths, so $|M^*| - |M| \\le \\sqrt{|V|}$. Thus, only $\\sqrt{|V|}$ additional iterations of the repeat loop can occur, so there are at most $2\\sqrt{|V|}$ iterations in total.</p> <p>g. For each unmatched vertex in $L$ we can perform a modified $\\text{BFS}$ to find the length of the shortest path to an unmatched vertex in $R$. Modify the $\\text{BFS}$ to ensure that we only traverse an edge if it causes the path to alternate between an edge in $M$ and an edge in $E - M$. The first time an unmatched vertex in $R$ is reached we know the length $k$ of a shortest augmenting path.</p> <p>We can use this to stop our search early if at any point we have traversed more than that number of edges. To find disjoint paths, start at the vertices of $R$ which were found at distance $k$ in the $\\text{BFS}$. Run a $\\text{DFS}$ backwards from these, which maintains the property that the next vertex we pick has distance one fewer, and the edges alternate between being in $M$ and $E - M$. As we build up a path, mark the vertices as used so that we never traverse them again. This takes $O(E)$, so by part (f) the total runtime is $O(\\sqrt VE)$.</p>"},{"location":"Chap27/27.1/","title":"27.1 The basics of dynamic multithreading","text":""},{"location":"Chap27/27.1/#271-1","title":"27.1-1","text":"<p>Suppose that we spawn $\\text{P-FIB}(n - 2)$ in line 4 of $\\text{P-FIB}$, rather than calling it as is done in the code.

So, we have that if $x$ is the $k$th pivot value, $\\det(A_k) = x\\det(A_{k \u2212 1})$, giving us the desired result that the $k$th pivot value is $\\det(A_k) / \\det(A_{k \u2212 1})$.</p>"},{"location":"Chap28/28.3/#283-6","title":"28.3-6","text":"<p>Find the function of the form</p> <p>$$F(x) = c_1 + c_2x\\lg x + c_3 e^x$$</p> <p>that is the best least-squares fit to the data points</p> <p>$$(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 8).$$</p> <p>First we form the $A$ matrix</p> <p>$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp;      0 &amp; e   \\\\ 1 &amp;      2 &amp; e^2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 3\\lg 3 &amp; e^3 \\\\ 1 &amp;      8 &amp; e^4 \\end{pmatrix} . $$</p> <p>We compute the pseudoinverse, then multiply it by $y$, to obtain the coefficient vector</p> <p>$$ c = \\begin{pmatrix}  0.411741 \\\\ -0.20487  \\\\  0.16546 \\end{pmatrix} . $$</p>"},{"location":"Chap28/28.3/#283-7","title":"28.3-7","text":"<p>Show that the pseudoinverse $A^+$ satisfies the following four equations:</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned}            AA^+A &amp; = A, \\\\          A^+AA^+ &amp; = A^+, \\\\ (AA^+)^{\\text T} &amp; = AA^+, \\\\ (A^+A)^{\\text T} &amp; = A^+A. \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} AA^+A &amp; = A((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T})A \\\\       &amp; = A(A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}(A^{\\text T}A) \\\\       &amp; = A, \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} A^+AA^+ &amp; = ((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T})A((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T}) \\\\         &amp; = (A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}(A^{\\text T}A)(A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T} \\\\         &amp; = (A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T} \\\\         &amp; = A^+, \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} (AA^+)^{\\text T}     &amp; = (A(A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T})^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = A((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1})^{\\text T}A^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = A((A^{\\text T}A)^{\\text T})^{-1}A^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = A(A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = AA^+, \\end{aligned} $$</p> <p>$$ \\begin{aligned} (A^+A)^{\\text T}     &amp; = ((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}A^{\\text T}A)^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = ((A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}(A^{\\text T}A))^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = I^{\\text T} \\\\     &amp; = I \\\\     &amp; = (A^{\\text T}A)^{-1}(A^{\\text T}A) \\\\     &amp; = A^+A. \\end{aligned} $$</p>"},{"location":"Chap28/Problems/28-1/","title":"28-1 Tridiagonal systems of linear equations","text":"<p>Consider the tridiagonal matrix</p> <p>$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix}  1 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\\\ -1 &amp;  2 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\\\  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  2 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 \\\\  0 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  2 &amp; -1 \\\\  0 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  2 \\end{pmatrix} . $$</p> <p>a.

When performing the LU decomposition, we only need to take the max over at most two different rows, so the loop on line 7 of $\\text{LUP-DECOMPOSITION}$ drops to $O(1)$. There are only some constant number of nonzero entries in each row, so the loop on line 14 can also be reduced to being $O(1)$. Lastly, there are only some constant number of nonzero entries of the form $a_{ik}$ and $a_{kj}$. Since the square of a constant is also a constant, this means that the nested for loops on lines 16-19 also only take time $O(1)$ to run. Since the for loops on lines 3 and 5 both run $O(n)$ times and take $O(1)$ time each to run (provided we are smart to not consider a bunch of zero entries in the matrix), the total runtime can be brought down to $O(n)$.</p> <p>Since for a Tridiagonal matrix, it will only ever have finitely many nonzero entries in any row, we can do both the forward and back substitution each in time only $O(n)$.</p> <p>Since the asymptotics of performing the LU decomposition on a positive definite tridiagonal matrix is $O(n)$, and this decomposition can be used to solve the equation in time $O(n)$, the total time for solving it with this method is $O(n)$.

The runtime of our LUP decomposition algorithm drops to being $O(n)$ because we know there are only ever a constant number of nonzero entries in each row and column, as before. Once we have an LUP decomposition, we also know that that decomposition have both $L$ and $U$ having only a constant number of non-zero entries in each row and column. This means that when we perform the forward and backward substitution, we only spend a constant amount of time per entry in $x$, and so, only takes $O(n)$ time.</p>"},{"location":"Chap28/Problems/28-2/","title":"28-2 Splines","text":"<p>A pratical method for interpolating a set of points with a curve is to use cubic splines.

Since the matrix is symmetric and tridiagonal, Problem 28-1 (e) tells us that we can solve the equation in $O(n)$ time by performing an LUP decomposition. By part (a), once we know each $D_i$ we can compute each $f_i$ in $O(n)$ time.</p> <p>f. For the general case of solving the nonuniform natural cubic spline problem, we require that $f(x_{i + 1}) = f_i(x_{i + 1} \u2212 x_i) = y_{i + 1}$, $f'(x_{i + 1}) = f_i'(x_{i + 1} - x_i) = f_{i + 1}'(0)$ and $f''(x_{i + 1}) = f_i''(x_{i + 1} - x_i) = f_{i + 1}''(0)$. We can still solve for each of $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ and $d_i$ in terms of $y_i$, $y_{i + 1}$, $D_i$ and $D_{i + 1}$, so we still get a tridiagonal matrix equation.

If $a(u, v) &gt; 0$ for every pair of vertices, then, there is no point in sending any flow at all. So, an optimal solution is just to have no flow. This obviously satisfies the capacity constraints, it also satisfies the conservation constraints because the flow into and out of each vertex is zero.</p> <p>c. We assume that the edge $(t, s)$ is not in $E$ because that would be a silly edge to have for a maximum flow from $s$ to $t$. If it is there, remove it and it won't decrease the maximum flow. Let $V' = V$ and $E' = E \\cup \\{(t, s)\\}$. For the edges of $E'$ that are in $E$, let the capacity be as it is in $E$ and let the cost be $0$. For the other edge, we set $c(t, s) = \\infty$ and $a(t, s) = -1$. Then, if we have any circulation in $G'$, it will be trying to get as much flow to go across the edge $(t, s)$ in order to drive the objective function lower, the other flows will have no affect on the objective function. Then, by Kirchhoff's current law (a.k.a. common sense), the amount going across the edge $(t, s)$ is the same as the total flow in the rest of the network from $s$ to $t$. This means that maximizing the flow across the edge $(t, s)$ is also maximizing the flow from $s$ to $t$. So, all we need to do to recover the maximum flow for the original network is to keep the same flow values, but throw away the edge $(t, s)$.</p> <p>d. Suppose that $s$ is the vertex that we are computing shortest distance from. Then, we make the circulation network by first starting with the original graph, giving each edge a cost of whatever it was before and infinite capacity.
