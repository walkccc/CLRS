We compare it with $A[i]$. If they are the same, we return $i$, which is a correct result. Otherwise, we continue to the next step. We have already insured that $A[1..i - 1]$ does not contain $v$ and that $A[i]$ is different from $v$, so this step preserves the invariant.\n\n\nTermination:\n The loop terminates when $i > A.length$. Since $i$ increases by $1$ and $i > A.length$, we know that all the elements in $A$ have been checked and it has been found that $v$ is not among them.

Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$?\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwhile\n loop of lines 5\u20137 of procedure $\\text{INSERTION-SORT}$ scans backward through the sorted array $A[1..j - 1]$ to find the appropriate place for $A[j]$. The hitch is that the loop not only searches for the proper place for $A[j]$, but that it also moves each of the array elements that are bigger than $A[j]$ one position to the right (line 6). These movements can take as much as $\\Theta(j)$ time, which occurs when all the $j - 1$ elements preceding $A[j]$ are larger than $A[j]$. We can use binary search to improve the running time of the search to $\\Theta(\\lg j)$, but binary search will have no effect on the running time of moving the elements. Therefore, binary search alone cannot improve the worst-case running time of $\\text{INSERTION-SORT}$ to $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$.\n\n\n2.3-7 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$-time algorithm that, given a set $S$ of $n$ integers and another integer $x$, determines whether or not there exist two elements in $S$ whose sum is exactly $x$.\n\n\n\n\nThe following algorithm solves the problem:\n\n\n\n\nSort the elements in $S$.\n\n\nForm the set $S' = \\{z: z = x - y$ for some $y \\in S\\}$.\n\n\nSort the elements in $S'$.\n\n\nMerge the two sorted sets $S$ and $S'$.\n\n\nThere exist two elements in $S$ whose sum is exactly $x$ if and only if the same value appears in consecutive positions in the merged output.\n\n\n\n\nTo justify the claim in step 4, first observe that if any value appears twice in the merged output, it must appear in consecutive positions. Thus, we can restate the condition in step 5 as there exist two elements in $S$ whose sum is exactly $x$ if and only if the same value appears twice in the merged output.\n\n\nSuppose that some value $w$ appears twice. Then $w$ appeared once in $S$ and once in $S'$. Because $w$ appeared in $S'$, there exists some $y \\in S$ such that $w = x - y$, or $x = w + y$. Since $w \\in S$, the elements $w$ and $y$ are in $S$ and sum to $x$.\n\n\nConversely, suppose that there are values $w, y \\in S$ such that $w + y = x$. Then, since $x - y = w$, the value $w$ appears in $S'$. Thus, $w$ is in both $S$ and $S'$, and so it will appear twice in the merged output.\n\n\nSteps 1 and 3 require $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ steps. Steps 2, 4, 5, and 6 require $O(n)$ steps. Thus the overall running time is $O(n\\lg n)$.\n\n\nA reader submitted a simpler solution that also runs in $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ time. First, sort the elements in $S$, taking $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ time. Then, for each element $y$ in $S$, perform a binary search in $S$ for $x - y$. Each binary search takes $O(\\lg n)$ time, and there are are most $n$ of them, and so the time for all the binary searches is $O(n\\lg n)$. The overall running time is $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$.\n\n\nAnother reader pointed out that since $S$ is a set, if the value $x / 2$ appears in $S$, it appears in $S$ just once, and so $x / 2$ cannot be a solution.",

The following algorithm solves the problem:   Sort the elements in $S$.  Form the set $S' = \\{z: z = x - y$ for some $y \\in S\\}$.  Sort the elements in $S'$.  Merge the two sorted sets $S$ and $S'$.  There exist two elements in $S$ whose sum is exactly $x$ if and only if the same value appears in consecutive positions in the merged output.   To justify the claim in step 4, first observe that if any value appears twice in the merged output, it must appear in consecutive positions. Thus, we can restate the condition in step 5 as there exist two elements in $S$ whose sum is exactly $x$ if and only if the same value appears twice in the merged output.  Suppose that some value $w$ appears twice. Then $w$ appeared once in $S$ and once in $S'$. Because $w$ appeared in $S'$, there exists some $y \\in S$ such that $w = x - y$, or $x = w + y$. Since $w \\in S$, the elements $w$ and $y$ are in $S$ and sum to $x$.  Conversely, suppose that there are values $w, y \\in S$ such that $w + y = x$. Then, since $x - y = w$, the value $w$ appears in $S'$. Thus, $w$ is in both $S$ and $S'$, and so it will appear twice in the merged output.  Steps 1 and 3 require $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ steps. Steps 2, 4, 5, and 6 require $O(n)$ steps. Thus the overall running time is $O(n\\lg n)$.  A reader submitted a simpler solution that also runs in $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ time. First, sort the elements in $S$, taking $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ time. Then, for each element $y$ in $S$, perform a binary search in $S$ for $x - y$. Each binary search takes $O(\\lg n)$ time, and there are are most $n$ of them, and so the time for all the binary searches is $O(n\\lg n)$. The overall running time is $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$.  Another reader pointed out that since $S$ is a set, if the value $x / 2$ appears in $S$, it appears in $S$ just once, and so $x / 2$ cannot be a solution.",

The pairwise merging requires $\\Theta(n)$ work at each level, since we are still working on $n$ elements, even if they are partitioned among sublists. The number of levels, starting with $n / k$ lists (with $k$ elements each) and finishing with 1 list (with $n$ elements), is $\\lceil \\lg(n / k) \\rceil$.

The loop invariant trivially holds.\n\n\nMaintenance:\n Consider an iteration for a given value of $j$. By the loop invariant, $A[j]$ is the smallest value in $A[j..n]$. Lines 3\u20134 exchange $A[j]$  and $A[j - 1]$ if $A[j]$ is less than $A[j - 1]$, and so $A[j - 1]$ will be the smallest value in $A[j - 1..n]$ afterward. Since the only change to the subarray $A[j - 1..n]$ is this possible exchange, and the subarray $A[j..n]$ is a permutation of the values that were in $A[j..n]$ at the time that the loop started, we see that $A[j - 1..n]$ is a permutation of the values that were in $A[j - 1..n]$ at the time that the loop started. Decrementing $j$ for the next iteration maintains the invariant.\n\n\nTermination:\n The loop terminates when $j$ reaches $i$. By the statement of the loop invariant, $A[i] = \\min\\{A[k]: i \\le k \\le n\\}$ and $A[i..n]$ is a permutation of the values that were in $A[i..n]$ at the time that the loop started.\n\n\nc.\n \nLoop invariant:\n At the start of each iteration of the \nfor\n loop of lines 1\u20134, the subarray $A[1..i - 1]$ consists of the $i - 1$ smallest values originally in $A[1..n]$, in sorted order, and $A[i..n]$ consists of the $n - i + 1$ remaining values originally in $A[1..n]$.\n\n\nInitialization:\n Before the first iteration of the loop, $i = 1$.

By the loop invariant, $A[1..i - 1]$ consists of the $i$ smallest values in $A[1..n]$, in sorted order. Part (b) showed that after executing the \nfor\n loop of lines 2\u20134, $A[i]$ is the smallest value in $A[i..n]$, and so $A[1..i]$ is now the $i$ smallest values originally in $A[1..n]$, in sorted order. Moreover, since the \nfor\n loop of lines 2\u20134 permutes $A[i..n]$, the subarray $A[i + 1..n]$ consists of the $n - i$ remaining values originally in $A[1..n]$.\n\n\nTermination:\n The \nfor\n loop of lines 1\u20134 terminates when $i = n$, so that $i - 1 = n - 1$. By the statement of the loop invariant, $A[1..i - 1]$ is the subarray $A[1..n - 1]$, and it consists of the $n - 1$ smallest values originally in $A[1..n]$, in sorted order. The remaining element must be the largest value in $A[1..n]$, and it is in $A[n]$. Therefore, the entire array $A[1..n]$ is sorted.\n\n\nNote:\n Tn the second edition, the \nfor\n loop of lines 1\u20134 had an upper bound of $A.length$. The last iteration of the outer \nfor\n loop would then result in no iterations of the inner \nfor\n loop of lines 1\u20134, but the termination argument would simplify: $A[1..i - 1]$ would be the entire array $A[1..n]$, which, by the loop invariant, is sorted.\n\n\nd.\n The running time depends on the number of iterations of the \nfor\n loop of lines 2\u20134. For a given value of $i$, this loop makes $n - i$ iterations, and $i$ takes on the values $1, 2, \\ldots, n - 1$. The total number of iterations, therefore, is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} (n - i) \n    & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} - \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i \\\\\n    & = n(n - 1) - \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{n^2}{2} - \\frac{n}{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the running time of bubblesort is $\\Theta(n^2)$ in all cases.

Justify your answer.\n\n\nd.\n Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation of $n$ elements in $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ worst-case time. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Modify merge sort).\n\n\n\n\na.\n The inversions are $(1,5)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, $(3,5)$, $(4,5)$. (Remember that inversions are specified by indices rather than by the values in the array.)\n\n\nb.\n The array with elements from $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ with the most inversions is $\\langle n, n - 1, n - 2, \\ldots, 2, 1 \\rangle$. For all $1 \\le i < j \\le n$, there is an inversion $(i, j)$. The number of such inversions is $\\binom{n}{2} = n(n - 1) / 2$.\n\n\nc.\n Suppose that the array $A$ starts out with an inversion $(k, j)$. Then $k < j$ and $A[k] > A[j]$. At the time that the outer \nfor\n loop of lines 1\u20138 sets $key = A[j]$\u008d, the value that started in $A[k]$\u008d is still somewhere to the left of $A[j]$\u008d. That is, it's in $A[i]$\u008d, where $1 \\le i < j$, and so the inversion has become $(i, j)$. Some iteration of the \nwhile\n loop of lines 5\u20137 moves $A[i]$\u008d one position to the right. Line 8 will eventually drop $key$ to the left of this element, thus eliminating the inversion. Because line 5 moves only elements that are greater than $key$, it moves only elements that correspond to inversions. In other words, each iteration of the \nwhile\n loop of lines 5\u20137 corresponds to the elimination of one inversion.\n\n\nd.\n We follow the hint and modify merge sort to count the number of inversions in $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ time.\n\n\nTo start, let us define a \nmerge-inversion\n as a situation within the execution of merge sort in which the $\\text{MERGE}$ procedure, after copying $A[p..q]$\u008d to $L$ and $A[q + 1..r]$ to $R$, has values $x$ in $L$ and $y$ in $R$ such that $x > y$. Consider an inversion $(i, j)$, and let $x = A[i]$\u008d and $y = A[j]$ \u008d, so that $i < j$ and $x > y$. We claim that if we were to run merge sort, there would be exactly one mergeinversion involving $x$ and $y$. To see why, observe that the only way in which array elements change their positions is within the $\\text{MERGE}$ procedure. Moreover, since $\\text{MERGE}$ keeps elements within $L$ in the same relative order to each other, and correspondingly for $R$, the only way in which two elements can change their ordering relative to each other is for the greater one to appear in $L$ and the lesser one to appear in $R$. Thus, there is at least one merge-inversion involving $x$ and $y$. To see that there is exactly one such merge-inversion, observe that after any call of $\\text{MERGE}$ that involves both $x$ and $y$, they are in the same sorted subarray and will therefore both appear in $L$ or both appear in $R$ in any given call thereafter. Thus, we have proven the claim.\n\n\nWe have shown that every inversion implies one merge-inversion. In fact, the correspondence between inversions and merge-inversions is one-to-one. Suppose we have a merge-inversion involving values $x$ and $y$, where $x$ originally was $A[i]$\u008d and $y$ was originally $A[j]$\u008d. Since we have a merge-inversion, $x > y$. And since $x$ is in $L$ and $y$ is in $R$, $x$ must be within a subarray preceding the subarray containing $y$. Therefore $x$ started out in a position $i$ preceding $y$'s original position $j$, and so $(i, j)$ is an inversion.\n\n\nHaving shown a one-to-one correspondence between inversions and mergeinversions, it suffices for us to count merge-inversions.\n\n\nConsider a merge-inversion involving $y$ in $R$. Let $z$ be the smallest value in $L$ that is greater than $y$. At some point during the merging process, $z$ and $y$ will be the \"exposed\" values in $L$ and $R$, i.e., we will have $z = L[i]$\u008d and $y = R[j]$\u008d in line 13 of $\\text{MERGE}$. At that time, there will be merge-inversions involving $y$ and $L[i], L[i + 1], L[i + 2], \\ldots, L[n_1]$\u008d, and these $n_1 - i + 1$ merge-inversions will be the only ones involving $y$. Therefore, we need to detect the first time that $z$ and $y$ become exposed during the $\\text{MERGE}$ procedure and add the value of $n_1 - i + 1$ at that time to our total count of merge-inversions.\n\n\nThe following pseudocode, modeled on merge sort, works as we have just described.

If we were to do a straight substitution proof, it would be rather involved. Instead, we will show by substitution that $T(n) \\le n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor})$ and $T(n) \\ge n \\cdot H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil}$, where $H_k$ is the $k$th harmonic number: $H_k = 1 / 1 + 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + \\cdots + 1 / k$. We also define $H_0 = 0$. Since $H_k = \\Theta(\\lg k)$, we have that $H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor} = \\Theta(\\lg \\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor) = \\Theta(\\lg\\lg n)$ and $H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil} = \\Theta(\\lg \\lceil \\lg n \\rceil) = \\Theta(\\lg\\lg n)$. Thus, we will have that $T(n) = \\Theta(n\\lg\\lg n)$.\n\n\nThe base case for the proof is for $n = 1$, and we use $T(1) = 1$. Here, $\\lg n = 0$, so that $\\lg n = \\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor = \\lceil \\lg n \\rceil$. Since $H_0 = 0$, we have $T(1) = 1 \\le 1(1 + H_0)$ and $T(1) = 1 \\ge 0 = 1 \\cdot H_0$.\n\n\nFor the upper bound of $T(n) \\le n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor})$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & =   2T(n / 2) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & \\le 2((n / 2)(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg (n / 2) \\rfloor})) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & =   n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n - 1 \\rfloor}) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & =   n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor - 1} + 1 / \\lg n) \\\\\n     & \\le n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor - 1} + 1 / \\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor) \\\\\n     & =   n(1 + H_{\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor}),\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhere the last line follows from the identity $H_k = H_{k - 1} + 1 / k$.\n\n\nThe upper bound of $T(n) \\ge n \\cdot H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil}$ is similar:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & =   2T(n / 2) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & \\ge 2((n / 2) \\cdot H_{\\lceil \\lg (n / 2) \\rceil}) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & =   n \\cdot (H_{\\lceil \\lg n - 1 \\rceil}) + n / \\lg n \\\\\n     & =   n \\cdot (H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil - 1} + 1 / \\lg n) \\\\\n     & \\ge n \\cdot (H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil - 1} + 1 / \\lceil \\lg n \\rceil) \\\\\n     & =   n \\cdot (H_{\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil}).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, $T(n) = \\Theta(n\\lg\\lg n)$.\n\n\nf.\n $T(n) = T(n / 2) + T(n / 4) + T(n / 8) + n$\n\nUsing the recursion tree shown below, we get a guess of $T(n) = \\Theta(n)$.\n\n\n\n\nWe use the substitution method to prove that $T(n) = O(n)$. Our inductive hypothesis is that $T(n) \\le cn$ for some constant $c > 0$.

For the base case, we have $T(1) = 1 = H_1$.

Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\text{Chip $A$ says} & \\text{Chip $B$ says} & \\text{Conclusion} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{$B$ is good} & \\text{$A$ is good} & \\text{both are good, or both are bad} \\\\\n\\text{$B$ is good} & \\text{$A$ is bad}  & \\text{at least one is bad} \\\\\n\\text{$B$ is bad}  & \\text{$A$ is good} & \\text{at least one is bad} \\\\\n\\text{$B$ is bad}  & \\text{$A$ is bad}  & \\text{at least one is bad}\n\\end{array}\n\n\na.\n Show that if more than $n / 2$ chips are bad, the professor cannot necessarily determine which chips are good using any strategy based on this kind of pairwise test. Assume that the bad chips can conspire to fool the professor.\n\n\nb.\n Consider the problem of finding a single good chip from among $n$ chips, assuming that more than $n / 2$ of the chips are good. Show that $\\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor$ pairwise tests are sufficient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.\n\n\nc.\n Show that the good chips can be identified with $\\Theta(n)$ pairwise tests, assuming that more than $n / 2$ chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that describes the number of tests.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Lets say that there are $g < n / 2$ good chips. The same amount of the remaining bad chips can choose to act similar to good chips. That is, they can identify each other as good and all other as faulty. Since this is what the good chips would do, both groups are symmetric in regards to the operation of parwise comparison. No strategy can distinguish between the two groups.\n\n\nb.\n We split the chips in groups of two and compare them. We can take one of the chips if the outcome is the first one (both are good or both are bad) and put both away otherwise. When putting away, we're removing at least one bad chip for every good one we remove. Out of the pairs we've chosen a chip from, there would be more good chips than bad chips (there would be more good pairs, because the good chips are more than the half). Now we have at most $n / 2$ chips, where at least half of them are good.\n\n\nc.\n The recurrence for finding at least one good chip is\n\n\n$$T(n) = T(n / 2) + n / 2.$$\n\n\nBy the master method, this is $\\Theta(n)$. After we've found one, we can compare it will all others, which is a $\\Theta(n)$ operation.",

We could enumerate all $n!$ permutations, count the total number of fixed points, and divide by $n!$ to determine the average number of fixed points per permutation. This would be a painstaking process, and the answer would turn out to be $1$. We can use indicator random variables, however, to arrive at the same answer much more easily.\n\n\nDefine a random variable $X$ that equals the number of customers that get back their own hat, so that we want to compute $\\text E[X]$.\n\n\nFor $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, define the indicator random variable\n\n\n$$X_i = I\\{\\text{customer $i$ gets back his own hat}\\}.$$\n\n\nThen $X = X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n$.\n\n\nSince the ordering of hats is random, each customer has a probability of $1 / n$ of getting back his or her own hat. In other words, $\\Pr\\{X_i = 1\\} = 1 / n$, which, by Lemma 5.1, implies that $\\text E[X_i] = 1 / n$.\n\n\nThus,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X] & = \\text E \\Bigg[ \\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i \\Bigg] \\\\\n           & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\text E[X_i] & \\text{(linearity of expectation)} \\\\\n           & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n 1 / n \\\\\n           & =  1,\n\\end{align}\n\n\nand so we expect that exactly 1 customer gets back his own hat.\n\n\nNote that this is a situation in which the indicator random variables are not independent. For example, if $n = 2$ and $X_1 = 1$, then $X_2$ must also equal $1$. Conversely, if $n = 2$ and $X_1 = 0$, then $X_2$ must also equal $0$. Despite the dependence, $\\Pr\\{X_i = 1\\} = 1 / n$ for all $i$, and linearity of expectation holds. Thus, we can use the technique of indicator random variables even in the presence of dependence.\n\n\n5.2-5\n\n\n\n\nLet $A[1..n]$ be an array of $n$ distinct numbers. If $i < j$ and $A[i] > A[j]$, then the pair $(i, j)$ is called an \ninversion\n of $A$. (See Problem 2-4 for more on inversions.) Suppose that the elements of $A$ form a uniform random permutation of $\\langle 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\rangle$. Use indicator random variables to compute the expected number of inversions.\n\n\n\n\nLet $X_{ij}$ be an indicator random variable for the event where the pair $A[i]$, $A[j]$ for $i < j$ is inverted, i.e., $A[i] > A[j]$. More precisely, we define $X_{ij} = I\\{A[i] > A[j]\\}$ for $1 \\le i < j \\le n$. We have $\\Pr\\{X_{ij} = 1\\} = 1 / 2$, because given two distinct random numbers, the probability that the first is bigger than the second is $1 / 2$. By Lemma 5.1, $E[X_{ij}] = 1 / 2$.\n\n\nLet $X$ be the the random variable denoting the total number of inverted pairs in the array, so that\n\n\n$$X = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ij}.$$\n\n\nWe want the expected number of inverted pairs, so we take the expectation of both sides of the above equation to obtain\n\n\n$$\\text E[X] = \\text E \\Bigg[\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ij} \\Bigg].$$\n\n\nWe use linearity of expectation to get\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X] & = \\text E \\Bigg[\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ij} \\Bigg] \\\\\n           & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n \\text E[X_{ij}] \\\\\n           & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n 1 / 2 \\\\\n           & = \\binom{n}{2}\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n           & = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n           & = \\frac{n(n - 1)}{4}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus the expected number of inverted pairs is $n(n - 1) / 4$.",

We make three obervations:   Candidate 1 is always hired.  The best candidate, i.e., the one whose rank is $n$, is always hired.  If the best candidate is candidate 1, then that is the only candidate hired.   Therefore, in order for $\\text{HIRE-ASSISTANT}$ to hire exactly twice, candidate 1 must have rank $i \\le n - 1$ and all candidates whose ranks are $i + 1, i + 2, \\ldots, n - 1$ must be interviewed after the candidate whose rank is $n$.

Letting $j$ denote the position in the interview order of the best candidate, let $F$ be the event in which candidates $2, 3, \\ldots, j - 1$ have ranks strictly less than the rank of candidate 1.

For example, consider its operation when $n = 3$, when it should be able to produce the $n! - 1 = 5$ nonidentity permutations. The \nfor\n loop iterates for $i = 1$ and $i = 2$. When $i = 1$, the call to $\\text{RANDOM}$ returns one of two possible values (either $2$ or $3$), and when $i = 2$, the call to $\\text{RANDOM}$ returns just one value $(3)$. Thus, $\\text{PERMUTE-WITHOUT-IDENTITY}$ can produce only $2 \\cdot 1 = 2$ possible permutations, rather than the $5$ that are required.\n\n\n5.3-3\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that instead of swapping element $A[i]$ with a random element from the subarray $A[i..n]$, we swapped it with a random element from anywhere in the array:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nPERMUTE\n-\nWITH\n-\nALL\n(\nA\n)\n\n    \nn\n \n=\n \nA\n.\nlength\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nswap\n \nA\n[\ni\n]\n \nwith\n \nA\n[\nRANDOM\n(\n1\n,\n \nn\n)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this code produce a uniform random permutation? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\nThe $\\text{PERMUTE-WITH-ALL}$ procedure does not produce a uniform random permutation. Consider the permutations it produces when $n = 3$. The procedure makes 3 calls to $\\text{RANDOM}$, each of which returns one of 3 values, and so calling $\\text{PERMUTE-WITH-ALL}$ has 27 possible outcomes. Since there are $3! = 6$ permutations, if $\\text{PERMUTE-WITH-ALL}$ did produce a uniform random permutation, then each permutation would occur $1 / 6$ of the time. That would mean that each permutation would have to occur an integer number $m$ times, where $m / 27 = 1 / 6$. No integer $m$ satisfies this condition.\n\n\nIn fact, if we were to work out the possible permutations of $\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$ and how often they occur with $\\text{PERMUTE-WITH-ALL}$, we would get the following probabilities:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text{permutation} & \\text{probability} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle & 4 / 27 \\\\\n\\langle 1, 3, 2 \\rangle & 5 / 27 \\\\\n\\langle 2, 1, 3 \\rangle & 5 / 27 \\\\\n\\langle 2, 3, 1 \\rangle & 5 / 27 \\\\\n\\langle 3, 1, 2 \\rangle & 4 / 27 \\\\\n\\langle 3, 2, 1 \\rangle & 4 / 27 \n\\end{array}\n\n\nAlthough these probabilities sum to $1$, none are equal to $1 / 6$.\n\n\n5.3-4\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Armstrong suggests the following procedure for generating a uniform random permutation:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nPERMUTE\n-\nBY\n-\nCYCLE\n(\nA\n)\n\n    \nn\n \n=\n \nA\n.\nlength\n\n    \nlet\n \nB\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n]\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \narray\n\n    \noffset\n \n=\n \nRANDOM\n(\n1\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \ndest\n \n=\n \ni\n \n+\n \noffset\n\n        \nif\n \ndest\n \n>\n \nn\n\n            \ndest\n \n=\n \ndest\n \n-\n \nn\n\n        \nB\n[\ndest\n]\n \n=\n \nA\n[\ni\n]\n\n    \nreturn\n \nB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow that each element $A[i]$ has a $1 / n$ probability of winding up in any particular position in $B$.

That is, $B[((i + offset - 1)\\mod n) + 1] = A[i]$. (The subtraction and addition of $1$ in the index calculation is due to the $1$-origin indexing. If we had used $0$-origin indexing instead, the index calculation would have simplied to $B[(i + offset)\\mod n] = A[i]$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1$.)\n\n\nThus, once offset is determined, so is the entire permutation. Since each value of offset occurs with probability $1 / n$, each element $A[i]$ has a probability of ending up in position $B[j]$ with probability $1 / n$.\n\n\nThis procedure does not produce a uniform random permutation, however, since it can produce only $n$ different permutations.

Show that the following recursive procedure returns a random $m$-subset $S$ of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$, in which each $m$-subset is equally likely, while making only $m$ calls to $\\text{RANDOM}$:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nRANDOM\n-\nSAMPLE\n(\nm\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nm\n \n==\n \n0\n\n        \nreturn\n \n\u2205\n\n    \nelse\n \nS\n \n=\n \nRANDOM\n-\nSAMPLE\n(\nm\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nn\n \n-\n \n1\n)\n\n        \ni\n \n=\n \nRANDOM\n(\n1\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n        \nif\n \ni\n \n\u2208\n \nS\n\n            \nS\n \n=\n \nS\n \n\u222a\n \n{\nn\n}\n\n        \nelse\n \nS\n \n=\n \nS\n \n\u222a\n \n{\ni\n}\n\n        \nreturn\n \nS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince each recursive call reduces $m$ by $1$ and makes only one call to $\\text{RANDOM}$, it's easy to see that there are a total of $m$ calls to $\\text{RANDOM}$. Moreover, since each recursive call adds exactly one element to the set, it's easy to see that the resulting set $S$ contains exactly $m$ elements.\n\n\nBecause the elements of set $S$ are chosen independently of each other, it suffices to show that each of the $n$ values appears in $S$ with probability $m / n$. We use an inductive proof. The inductive hypothesis is that a call to $\\text{RANDOM-SUBSET}(m, n)$ returns a set $S$ of $m$ elements, each appearing with probability $m / n$. The base cases are for $m = 0$ and $m = 1$. When $m = 0$, the returned set is empty, and so it contains each element with probability $0$. When $m = 1$, the returned set has one element, and it is equally likely to be any number in $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$\n\n\nFor the inductive step, we assume that the call $\\text{RANDOM-SUBSET}(m - 1, n - 1)$ returns a set $S'$ of $m - 1$ elements in which each value in ${1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n - 1}$ occurs with probability $(m - 1) / (n - 1)$. After the line $i = \\text{RANDOM}(1, n)$, $i$ is equally likely to be any value in ${1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n}$. We consider separately the probabilities that $S$ contains $j < n$ and that $S$ contains $n$.

Since each value of offset occurs with probability $1 / n$, each element $A[i]$ has a probability of ending up in position $B[j]$ with probability $1 / n$.

To make the recursive calls traverse the longest path to a leaf, choose values that make $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$ always recurse on the left child. It follows the left branch when the left child is greater than or equal to the right child, so putting $0$ at the root and $1$ at all the other nodes, for example, will accomplish that. With such values, $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$ will be called $h$ times (where $h$ is the heap height, which is the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf), so its running time will be $\\Theta(h)$ (since each call does $\\Theta(1)$ work), which is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$. Since we have a case in which $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$'s running time is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$, its worst-case running time is \u007f$\\Omega(\\lg n)$.",

For example, although all nodes at depth $H$ have height $0$, nodes at depth $H - 1$ can have either height $0$ or height $1$.\n\n\n\n\nFor a complete binary tree, it's easy to show that there are $\\lceil n / 2^{h + 1}\\rceil$ nodes of height $h$. But the proof for an incomplete tree is tricky and is not derived from the proof for a complete tree.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nBy induction on $h$.\n\n\nBasis\uff1a\n Show that it's true for $h = 0$ (i.e., that # of leaves $\\le \\lceil n / 2^{h + 1} \\rceil = \\lceil n / 2 \\rceil$ In fact, we'll show that the # of leaves $= \\lceil n / 2 \\rceil$.\n\n\nThe tree leaves (nodes at height $0$) are at depths $H$ and $H - 1$. They consist of\n\n\n\n\nall nodes at depth $H$, and\n\n\nthe nodes at depth $H - 1$ that are not parents of depth-$H$ nodes.\n\n\n\n\nLet $x$ be the number of nodes at depth $H$\u2014that is, the number of nodes in the bottom (possibly incomplete) level.\n\n\nNote that $n - x$ is odd, because the $n - x$ nodes above the bottom level form a complete binary tree, and a complete binary tree has an odd number of nodes ($1$ less than a power of $2$). Thus if $n$ is odd, $x$ is even, and if $n$ is even, $x$ is odd.\n\n\nTo prove the base case, we must consider separately the case in which $n$ is even ($x$ is odd) and the case in which $n$ is odd ($x$ is even). Here are two ways to do this: The first requires more cleverness, and the second requires more algebraic manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst method of proving the base case:  \n\n\n\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then $x$ is even, so all nodes have siblings\u2014i.e., all internal nodes have $2$ children. Thus (see Exercise B.5-3),# of internal nodes $=$ # of leaves $- 1$.\n\n    So, $n =$ # of nodes $=$ # of leaves $+$ # of internal nodes $ = 2 \\cdot$ # of leaves $- 1$. Thus, # of leaves $= (n + 1) / 2$. (The latter equality holds because $n$ is odd.)\n\n\nIf $n$ is even, then $x$ is odd, and some leaf doesn't have a sibling. If we gave it a sibling, we would have $n + 1$ nodes, where $n + 1$ is odd, so the case we analyzed above would apply. Observe that we would also increase the number of leaves by $1$, since we added a node to a parent that already had a child.

My initial solution was wrong. Also, heapsort appeared in 1964, but the lower bound was proved by Schaffer and Sedgewick in 1992. It's evil to put this an exercise.\n\n\nLet's assume that the heap is a full binary tree with $n = 2^k - 1$.

Let's consider their arrangement in the heap and color the leaves to be red and the inner nodes to be blue. The colored nodes are a subtree of the heap (otherwise there would be a contradiction). Since there are $2^{k - 1}$ colored nodes, at most $2^{k - 2}$ are red, which means that at least $2^{k - 2} - 1$ are blue.\n\n\nWhile the red nodes can jump directly to the root, the blue nodes need to travel up before they get removed. Let's count the number of swaps to move the blue nodes to the root. The minimal case of swaps is when (1) there are $2^{k - 2} - 1$ blue nodes and (2) they are arranged in a binary tree. If there are $d$ such blue nodes, then there would be $i = \\lg d$ levels, each containing $2^i$ nodes with length $i$. Thus the number of swaps is,\n\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\lg d}i2^i = 2 + (\\lg d - 2)2^{\\lg d} = \\Omega(d\\lg d).$$\n\n\nAnd now for a lazy (but cute) trick.

When we put it in the $i$th position, then $A[i..n]$ contains the largest elements, sorted. Decreasing the heap size and calling $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$ turns $A[1..i - 1]$ into a max-heap. Decrementing $i$ sets up the invariant for the next iteration.  Termination:  After the loop $i = 1$. This means that $A[2..n]$ is sorted and $A[1]$ is the smallest element in the array, which makes the array sorted.",

Also, heapsort appeared in 1964, but the lower bound was proved by Schaffer and Sedgewick in 1992. It's evil to put this an exercise.  Let's assume that the heap is a full binary tree with $n = 2^k - 1$. There are $2^{k - 1}$ leaves and $2^{k - 1} - 1$ inner nodes.  Let's look at sorting the first $2^{k - 1}$ elements of the heap. Let's consider their arrangement in the heap and color the leaves to be red and the inner nodes to be blue. The colored nodes are a subtree of the heap (otherwise there would be a contradiction). Since there are $2^{k - 1}$ colored nodes, at most $2^{k - 2}$ are red, which means that at least $2^{k - 2} - 1$ are blue.  While the red nodes can jump directly to the root, the blue nodes need to travel up before they get removed. Let's count the number of swaps to move the blue nodes to the root. The minimal case of swaps is when (1) there are $2^{k - 2} - 1$ blue nodes and (2) they are arranged in a binary tree. If there are $d$ such blue nodes, then there would be $i = \\lg d$ levels, each containing $2^i$ nodes with length $i$. Thus the number of swaps is,  $$\\sum_{i = 0}^{\\lg d}i2^i = 2 + (\\lg d - 2)2^{\\lg d} = \\Omega(d\\lg d).$$  And now for a lazy (but cute) trick. We've figured out a tight bound on sorting half of the heap. We have the following recurrence:  $$T(n) = T(n / 2) + \\Omega(n\\lg n).$$  Applying the master method, we get that $T(n) = \\Omega(n\\lg n)$.",

The root resides in $A[1]$, its $d$ children reside in order in $A[2]$ through $A[d + 1]$, their children reside in order in $A[d + 2]$ through $A[d^2 + d + 1]$, and so on.

Notice that the binary heap procedures are a special case of the above procedures when $d = 2$.\n\n\nb.\n Since each node has $d$ children, the height of a $d$-ary heap with $n$ nodes is $\\Theta(\\log_d n) = \\Theta(\\lg n / \\lg d)$.\n\n\nc.\n The procedure $\\text{HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX}$ given in the text for binary heaps works fine for $d$-ary heaps too. The change needed to support $d$-ary heaps is in $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$, which must compare the argument node to all d children instead of just $2$ children. The running time of $\\text{HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX}$ is still the running time for $\\text{MAX-HEAPIFY}$, but that now takes worst-case time proportional to the product of the height of the heap by the number of children examined at each node (at most $d$), namely $\\Theta(d \\log_d n) = \\Theta(d\\lg n / \\lg d)$.\n\n\nd.\n The procedure $\\text{MAX-HEAP-INSERT}$ given in the text for binary heaps works fine for $d$-ary heaps too, assuming that $\\text{HEAP-INCREASE-KEY}$ works for $d$-ary heaps. The worst-case running time is still $\\Theta(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the heap. (Since only parent pointers are followed, the number of children a node has is irrelevant.)

One iteration reduces the number of elements from $n$ to $\\alpha n$, and $i$ iterations reduces the number of elements to $\\alpha^i n$. At a leaf, there is just one remaining element, and so at a minimum-depth leaf of depth $m$, we have $\\alpha^m n = 1$. Thus, $\\alpha^m = 1 / n$. Taking logs, we get $m\\lg\\alpha = -\\lg n$, or $m = -\\lg n / \\lg\\alpha$.\n\n\nSimilarly, maximum depth corresponds to always taking the larger part of the partition, i.e., keeping a fraction $1 - \\alpha$ of the elements each time.

One iteration reduces the number of elements from $n$ to $\\alpha n$, and $i$ iterations reduces the number of elements to $\\alpha^i n$. At a leaf, there is just one remaining element, and so at a minimum-depth leaf of depth $m$, we have $\\alpha^m n = 1$. Thus, $\\alpha^m = 1 / n$. Taking logs, we get $m\\lg\\alpha = -\\lg n$, or $m = -\\lg n / \\lg\\alpha$.  Similarly, maximum depth corresponds to always taking the larger part of the partition, i.e., keeping a fraction $1 - \\alpha$ of the elements each time. The maximum depth $M$ is reached when there is one element left, that is, when $(1 - \\alpha)^M n = 1$. Thus, $M = -\\lg n / \\lg (1 - \\alpha)$.

(It doesn't matter that $q$ is not an integer when $n$ is even, since we're just trying to determine the minimum value of a function, knowing that when we constrain $q$ to integer values, the function's value will be no lower.)\n\n\nChoosing $q = (n - 1) / 2$ gives us the bound\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\min_{1 \\le q \\le n - 1} (q\\lg q + (n - q - 1)\\lg(n - q - 1)) \n    & \\ge \\frac{n - 1}{2}\\lg\\frac{n - 1}{2} + \\Big(n - \\frac{n - 1}{2} - 1\\Big)\\lg\\Big(n - \\frac{n - 1}{2} - 1\\Big) \\\\\n    & =   (n - 1)\\lg\\frac{n - 1}{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nContinuing with our bounding of $T(n)$, we obtain, for $n \\ge 2$,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & =   c(n - 1)\\lg\\frac{n - 1}{2} + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & =   c(n - 1)\\lg(n - 1) - c(n - 1) + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & =   cn\\lg(n - 1) - c\\lg(n - 1) - c(n - 1) + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & \\ge cn\\lg(n / 2) - c\\lg(n - 1) - c(n - 1) + \\Theta(n) & \\text{(since $n \\ge 2$)} \\\\\n     & =   cn\\lg n - cn - c\\lg(n - 1) - cn + c + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & =   cn\\lg n - (2cn + c\\lg(n - 1) - c) + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & \\ge cn\\lg n,\n\\end{align}\n\n\nsince we can pick the constant $c$ small enough so that the $\\Theta(n)$ term dominates the quantity $2cn + c\\lg(n - 1) - c$.

Upon calling quicksort on a subarray with fewer than $k$ elements, let it simply return without sorting the subarray. After the top-level call to quicksort returns, run insertion sort on the entire array to finish the sorting process. Argue that this sorting algorithm runs in $O(nk + n\\lg(n / k))$ expected time. How should we pick $k$, both in theory and practice?\n\n\n\n\nIn the quicksort part of the proposed algorithm, the recursion stops at level $\\lg(n / k)$, which makes the expected running time $O(n\\lg(n / k))$. However, this leaves $n / k$ non-sorted, non - intersecting subarrays of (maximum) length $k$.\n\n\nBecause of the nature of the insertion sort algorithm, it will first sort fully one such subarray before consider the next one. Thus, it has the same complexity as sorting each of those arrays, that is $\\frac{n}{k}O(k^2) = O(nk)$.\nIn theory, if we ignore the constant factors, we need to solve\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n            & n\\lg n \\ge nk + n\\lg{n / k} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\lg n \\ge k + \\lg n - \\lg k \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\lg k \\ge k.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWhich is not possible.\n\n\nIf we add the constant factors, we get\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n            & c_qn\\lg n \\ge c_ink + c_qn\\lg(n / k) \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & c_q\\lg n \\ge c_ik + c_q\\lg n - c_q\\lg k \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\lg k \\ge \\frac{c_i}{c_q}k.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWhich indicates that there might be a good candidate. Furthermore, the lower-order terms should be taken into consideration too.\n\n\nIn practice, $k$ should be chosed by experiment.\n\n\n7.4-6 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nConsider modifying the $\\text{PARTITION}$ procedure by randomly picking three elements from array $A$ and partitioning about their median (the middle value of the three elements). Approximate the probability of getting at worst an $\\alpha$-to-$(1 - \\alpha)$ split, as a function of $\\alpha$ in the range $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, for simplicity's sake, let's assume that we can pick the same element twice. Let's also assume that $0 < \\alpha \\le 1 / 2$.\n\n\nIn order to get such a split, two out of three elements need need to be in the smallest $\\alpha n$ elements.

            "text": "We can improve the running time of quicksort in practice by taking advantage of the fast running time of insertion sort when its input is \"nearly\" sorted. Upon calling quicksort on a subarray with fewer than $k$ elements, let it simply return without sorting the subarray. After the top-level call to quicksort returns, run insertion sort on the entire array to finish the sorting process. Argue that this sorting algorithm runs in $O(nk + n\\lg(n / k))$ expected time. How should we pick $k$, both in theory and practice?   In the quicksort part of the proposed algorithm, the recursion stops at level $\\lg(n / k)$, which makes the expected running time $O(n\\lg(n / k))$. However, this leaves $n / k$ non-sorted, non - intersecting subarrays of (maximum) length $k$.  Because of the nature of the insertion sort algorithm, it will first sort fully one such subarray before consider the next one. Thus, it has the same complexity as sorting each of those arrays, that is $\\frac{n}{k}O(k^2) = O(nk)$.\nIn theory, if we ignore the constant factors, we need to solve  \\begin{align}\n            & n\\lg n \\ge nk + n\\lg{n / k} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\lg n \\ge k + \\lg n - \\lg k \\\\\n\\Rightarrow & \\lg k \\ge k.\n\\end{align}  Which is not possible.

The information for the most recent call is at the top of the stack, and the information for the initial call is at the bottom. Upon calling a procedure, its information is \npushed\n onto the stack; when it terminates, its information is \npopped\n. Since we assume that array parameters are represented by pointers, the information for each procedure call on the stack requires $O(1)$ stack space. The \nstack depth\n is the maximum amount of stack space used at any time during a computation.\n\n\nb.\n Describe a scenario in which $\\text{TAIL-RECURSIVE-QUICKSORT}$'s stack depth is $\\Theta(n)$ on an $n$-element input array.\n\n\nc.\n Modify the code for $\\text{TAIL-RECURSIVE-QUICKSORT}$ so that the worst-case stack depth is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.

This executes the same operations as calling itself with $A$, $q + 1$, $r$, because in both cases, the first and third arguments ($A$ and $r$) have the same values as before, and $p$ has the old value of $q + 1$.\n\n\nb.\n The stack depth of $\\text{QUICKSORT}'$ will be $\\Theta(n)$ on an $n$-element input array if there are $\\Theta(n)$ recursive calls to $\\text{QUICKSORT}'$.

To avoid such behavior, we must change $\\text{QUICKSORT}'$ so that the recursive call is on a smaller interval of the array. The following variation of $\\text{QUICKSORT}'$ checks which of the two subarrays returned from $\\text{PARTITION}$ is smaller and recurses on the smaller subarray, which is at most half the size of the current array.

            "text": "One way to improve the $\\text{RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT}$ procedure is to partition around a pivot that is chosen more carefully than by picking a random element from the subarray. One common approach is the \nmedian-of-3\n method: choose the pivot as the median (middle element) of a set of 3 elements randomly selected from the subarray. (See exercise 7.4-6.) For this problem, let us assume that the elements of the input array $A[1..n]$ are distinct and that $n \\ge 3$. We denote the sorted output array by $A'[1..n]$. Using the median-of-3 method to choose the pivot element $x$, define $p_i = \\Pr\\{x = A'[i]\\}$.\n\n\na.\n Give an exact formula for $p_i$ as a function of $n$ and $i$ for $i = 2, 3, \\ldots, n - 1$. (Note that $p_1 = p_n = 0$.)\n\n\nb.\n By what amount have we increased the likelihood of choosing the pivot as $x = A'[\\lfloor (n + 1) / 2 \\rfloor]$, the median of $A[1..n]$, compared with the ordinary implementation?

There are 6 possible orderings of the three elements selected. So, suppose that $S'$ is the set of three elements selected. \n\n\nWe will compute the probability that the second element of $S'$ is $A'[i]$ among all possible $3$-sets we can pick, since there are exactly six ordered $3$-sets corresponding to each $3$-set, these probabilities will be equal. We will compute\nthe probability that $S'[2] = A[i]$. For any such $S'$, we would need to select\nthe first element from $[i - 1]$ and the third from ${i + 1, \\ldots , n}$. So, there are $(i - 1)(n - i)$ such $3$-sets.

As before, in the final  for  loop an element equal to one taken from $A$ earlier is placed before the earlier one (i.e., at a lower index position) in the output array $B$. The original algorithm was stable because an element taken from $A$ later started out with a lower index than one taken earlier.

            "text": "In this problem, we prove a probabilistic $\\Omega(n\\lg n)$ lower bound on the running time of any deterministic or randomized comparison sort on $n$ distinct input elements. We begin by examining a deterministic comparison sort $A$ with decision tree $T_A$. We assume that every permutation of $A$'s inputs is equally likely.\n\n\na.\n Suppose that each leaf of $T_A$ is labeled with the probability that it is reached given a random input. Prove that exactly $n!$ leaves are labeled $1 / n!$ and that the rest are labeled $0$.\n\n\nb.\n Let $D(T)$ denote the external path length of a decision tree $T$; that is, $D(T)$ is the sum of the depths of all the leaves of $T$. Let $T$ be a decision tree with $k > 1$ leaves, and let $LT$ and $RT$ be the left and right subtrees of $T$. Show that $D(T) = D(LT) + D(RT)+k$.\n\n\nc.\n Let $d(k)$ be the minimum value of $D(T)$ over all decision trees $T$ with $k > 1$ leaves. Show that $d(k) = \\min _{1 \\le i \\le k - 1} \\{ d(i) + d(k - i) + k \\}$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Consider a decision tree $T$ with $k$ leaves that achieves the minimum. Let $i_0$ be the number of leaves in $LT$ and $k - i_0$ the number of leaves in $RT$.)\n\n\nd.\n Prove that for a given value of $k > 1$ and $i$ in the range $1 \\le i \\le k - 1$, the function $i\\lg i + (k - i) \\lg(k - i)$ is minimized at $i = k / 2$. Conclude that $d(k) = \\Omega(k\\lg k)$.\n\n\ne.\n Prove that $D(T_A) = \\Omega(n!\\lg(n!))$, and conclude that the average-case time to sort $n$ elements is $\\Omega(n\\lg n)$.\n\n\nNow, consider a \nrandomized\n comparison sort $B$. We can extend the decision-tree model to handle randomization by incorporating two kinds of nodes: ordinary comparison nodes and ''randomization'' nodes. A randomization node models a random choice of the form $\\text{RANDOM}(1, r)$ made by algorithm $B$; the node has $r$ children, each of which is equally likely to be chosen during an execution of the algorithm.\n\n\nf.\n Show that for any randomized comparison sort $B$, there exists a deterministic comparison sort $A$ whose expected number of comparisons is no more than those made by $B$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n For a comparison algorithm $A$ to sort, no two input permutations can reach the same leaf of the decision tree, so there must be at least $n!$ leaves reached in $T_A$, one for each possible input permutation. Since $A$ is a deterministic algorithm, it must always reach the same leaf when given a particular permutation as input, so at most $n!$ leaves are reached (one for each permutation). Therefore exactly $n!$ leaves are reached, one for each input permutation.\n\n\nThese $n!$ leaves will each have probability $1 / n!$, since each of the $n!$ possible permutations is the input with the probability $1 / n!$. Any remaining leaves will have probability $0$, since they are not reached for any input.\n\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume for the rest of this problem that paths leading only to $0$-probability leaves aren't in the tree, since they cannot affect the running time of the sort. That is, we can assume that $T_A$ consists of only the $n!$ leaves labeled $1 / n!$ and their ancestors.\n\n\nb.\n If $k > 1$, then the root of $T$ is not a leaf. This implies that all of $T$'s leaves are leaves in $LT$ and $RT$. Since every leaf at depth $h$ in $LT$ or $RT$ has depth $h + 1$ in $T$, $D(T)$ must be the sum of $D(LT)$, $D(RT)$, and $k$, the total number of leaves. To prove this last assertion, let $d_T(x) =$ depth of node $x$ in tree $T$. Then,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nD(T) & = \\sum_{x \\in T} d_T(x) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{x \\in LT} d_T(x) + \\sum_{x \\in RT} d_T(x) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{x \\in LT} (d_{LT}(x) + 1) + \\sum_{x \\in RT} (d_{RT}(x) + 1) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{x \\in LT} d_{LT}(x) + \\sum_{x \\in RT} d_{RT}(x) + \\sum_{x \\in T} 1 \\\\\n     & = D(LT) + D(RT) + k. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n\nc.\n To show that $d(k) = \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1}{d(i) + d(k - i) + k}$ we will show separately that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n            & d(k) \\le \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1}{d(i) + d(k - i) + k} \\\\\n\\text{and } & d(k) \\ge \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1}{d(i) + d(k - i) + k}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show that $d(k) \\le \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1}{d(i) + d(k - i) + k}$, we need only show that $d(k) \\le d(i) + d(k - i) + k$, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1$. For any $i$ from $1$ to $k - 1$ we can find trees $RT$ with $i$ leaves and $LT$ with $k - i$ leaves such that $D(RT) = d(i)$ and $D(LT) = d(k - i)$. Construct $T$ such that $RT$ and $LT$ are the right and left subtrees of $T$'s root respectively. Then\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nd(k) & \\le D(T)                 & \\text{(by definition of $d$ as min $D(T)$ value)} \\\\\n     & =   D(RT) + D(LT) + k    & \\text{(by part (b))} \\\\\n     & =   d(i) + d(k - i) + k. & \\text{(by choice of $RT$ and $LT$)}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show that $d(k) \\ge \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1}{d(i) + d(k - i) + d}$, we need only show that $d(k) \\ge d(i) + d(k - i) + k$, for some $i$ in ${1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1}$. Take the tree $T$ with $k$ leaves such that $D(T) = d(k)$, let $RT$ and $LT$ be $T$'s right and left subtree, respectively, and let $i$ be the number of leaves in $RT$. Then $k - i$ is the number of leaves in $LT$ and\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nd(k) & =   D(T)                 & \\text{(by choice of $T$)} \\\\\n     & =   D(RT) + D(LT) + k    & \\text{(by part (b))} \\\\\n     & \\ge d(i) + d(k - i) + k. & \\text{(by definition of $d$ as min $D(T)$ value)}\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeither $i$ nor $k - i$ can be $0$ (and hence $1 \\le i \\le k - 1$), since if one of these were $0$, either $RT$ or $LT$ would contain all $k$ leaves of $T$, and that $k$-leaf subtree would have a $D$ equal to $D(T) - k$ (by part (b)), contradicting the choice of $T$ as the $k$-leaf tree with the minimum $D$.\n\n\nd.\n Let $f_k(i) = i\\lg i + (k - i)\\lg(k - i)$. To find the value of $i$ that minimizes $f_k$, find the $i$ for which the derivative of $f_k$ with respect to $i$ is $0$:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf_k'(i) & = \\frac{d}{di} \\Big(\\frac{i\\ln i + (k - i)\\ln(k - i)}{\\ln 2}\\Big) \\\\\n        & = \\frac{\\ln i + 1 - \\ln(k - i) - 1}{\\ln 2} \\\\\n        & = \\frac{\\ln i - \\ln(k - i)}{\\ln 2}\n\\end{align}\n\n\nis $0$ at $i = k / 2$. To verify this is indeed a minimum (not a maximum), check that the second derivative of $f_k$ is positive at $i = k / 2$:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf_k''(i) & = \\frac{d}{di}\\Big(\\frac{\\ln i - \\ln(k - i)}{\\ln 2}\\Big) \\\\\n         & = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}\\Big(\\frac{1}{i} + \\frac{1}{k - i}\\Big).\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{align}\nf_k''(k / 2) & = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2}\\Big(\\frac{2}{k} + \\frac{2}{k}\\Big) \\\\\n           & = \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{k} \\\\\n           & > 0 & \\text{since $k > 1$}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nNow we use substitution to prove $d(k) = \\Omega(k\\lg k)$. The base case of the induction is satisfied because $d(1) \\ge 0 = c \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\lg 1$ for any constant $c$. For the inductive step we assume that $d(i) \\ge ci\\lg i$ for $1 \\le i \\le k - 1$, where $c$ is some constant to be determined.\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nd(k) & =   \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1} {d(i) + d(k - i) + k} \\\\\n     & \\ge \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1} {c(i\\lg i + (k - i)\\lg(k - i)) + k} \\\\\n     & =   \\min_{1\\le i\\le k - 1} {cf_k(i) + k} \\\\\n     & =   c\\Big(\\frac{k}{2}\\lg\\frac{k}{2}\\Big(k - \\frac{k}{2}\\Big)\\lg\\Big(k - \\frac{k}{2}\\Big)\\Big) + k \\\\\n     & =   ck\\lg\\Big(\\frac{k}{2}\\Big) + k \\\\\n     & =   c(k\\lg k - k) + k \\\\\n     & =   ck\\lg k + (k - ck) \\\\\n     & \\ge ck\\lg k & \\text{if $c \\le 1$},\n\\end{align}\n\n\nand so $d(k) = \\Omega(k\\lg k)$.\n\n\ne.\n Using the result of part (d) and the fact that $T_A$ (as modified in our solution to part (a)) has $n!$ leaves, we can conclude that\n\n\n$$D(T_A) \\ge d(n!) = \\Omega(n!\\lg(n!)).$$\n\n\n$D(T_A)$ is the sum of the decision-tree path lengths for sorting all input permutations, and the path lengths are proportional to the run time. Since the $n!$ permutations have equal probability $1 / n!$, the expected time to sort $n$ random elements (1 input permutation) is the total time for all permutations divided by $n!$:\n\n\n$$\\frac{\\Omega(n!\\lg(n!))}{n!} = \\Omega(\\lg(n!)) = \\Omega(n\\lg n).$$\n\n\nf.\n We will show how to modify a randomized decision tree (algorithm) to define a deterministic decision tree (algorithm) that is at least as good as the randomized one in terms of the average number of comparisons.\n\n\nAt each randomized node, pick the child with the smallest subtree (the subtree with the smallest average number of comparisons on a path to a leaf). Delete all the other children of the randomized node and splice out the randomized node itself.\n\n\nThe deterministic algorithm corresponding to this modified tree still works, because the randomized algorithm worked no matter which path was taken from each randomized node.\n\n\nThe average number of comparisons for the modified algorithm is no larger than the average number for the original randomized tree, since we discarded the higher-average subtrees in each case. In particular, each time we splice out a randomized node, we leave the overall average less than or equal to what it was, because\n\n\n\n\nthe same set of input permutations reaches the modified subtree as before, but those inputs are handled in less than or equal to average time than before, and \n\n\nthe rest of the tree is unmodified.\n\n\n\n\nThe randomized algorithm thus takes at least as much time on average as the corresponding deterministic one. (We've shown that the expected running time for a deterministic comparison sort is \u007f$\\Omega(n\\lg n)$, hence the expected time for a randomized comparison sort is also $\\Omega(n\\lg n)$).",

Show how to sort the array in $O(n)$ time.\n\n\nb.\n You are given an array of strings, where different strings may have different numbers of characters, but the total number of characters over all the strings is $n$. Show how to sort the strings in $O(n)$ time.\n\n\n(Note that the desired order here is the standard alphabetical order; for example, $\\text a < \\text{ab} < \\text b$.)\n\n\n\n\na.\n The usual, unadorned radix sort algorithm will not solve this problem in the required time bound. The number of passes, $d$, would have to be the number of digits in the largest integer. Suppose that there are $m$ integers; we always have $m \\le n$. In the worst case, we would have one integer with $n / 2$ digits and $n / 2$ integers with one digit each. We assume that the range of a single digit is constant. Therefore, we would have $d = n / 2$ and $m = n / 2 + 1$, and so the running time would be $\\Theta(dm) = \\Theta(n^2)$.\n\n\nLet us assume without loss of generality that all the integers are positive and have no leading zeros. (If there are negative integers or $0$, deal with the positive numbers, negative numbers, and $0$ separately.) Under this assumption, we can observe that integers with more digits are always greater than integers with fewer digits. Thus, we can first sort the integers by number of digits (using counting sort), and then use radix sort to sort each group of integers with the same length. Noting that each integer has between $1$ and $n$ digits, let $m_i$ be the number of integers with $i$ digits, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Since there are $n$ digits altogether, we have $\\sum_{i = 1}^n i \\cdot m_i = n$.\n\n\nIt takes $O(n)$ time to compute how many digits all the integers have and, once the numbers of digits have been computed, it takes $O(m + n) = O(n)$ time to group the integers by number of digits. To sort the group with $m_i$ digits by radix sort takes $\\Theta(i \\cdot m_i)$ time. The time to sort all groups, therefore, is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^n \\Theta(i\\cdot m_i)\n    & = \\Theta\\Bigg(\\sum_{i = 1}^n i \\cdot m_i\\Bigg) \\\\\n    & = \\Theta(n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nb.\n One way to solve this problem is by a radix sort from right to left. Since the strings have varying lengths, however, we have to pad out all strings that are shorter than the longest string. The padding is on the right end of the string, and it's with a special character that is lexicographically less than any other character (e.g., in C, the character '\\0' with ASCII value $0$). Of course, we don't have to actually change any string; if we want to know the $j$th character of a string whose length is $k$, then if $j > k$, the $j$th character is the pad character.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this scheme does not always run in the required time bound. Suppose that there are $m$ strings and that the longest string has $d$ characters. In the worst case, one string has $n / 2$ characters and, before padding, $n / 2$ strings have one character each. As in part (a), we would have $d = n / 2$ and $m = n / 2 + 1$. We still have to examine the pad characters in each pass of radix sort, even if we don't actually create them in the strings. Assuming that the range of a single character is constant, the running time of radix sort would be $\\Theta(dm) = \\Theta(n^2)$.\n\n\nTo solve the problem in $O(n)$ time, we use the property that, if the first letter of string $x$ is lexicographically less that the first letter of string $y$, then $x$ is lexicographically less than $y$, regardless of the lengths of the two strings. We take advantage of this property by sorting the strings on the first letter, using counting sort. We take an empty string as a special case and put it first. We gather together all strings with the same first letter as a group. Then we recurse, within each group, based on each string with the first letter removed.\n\n\nThe correctness of this algorithm is straightforward. Analyzing the running time is a bit trickier. Let us count the number of times that each string is sorted by a call of counting sort. Suppose that the ith string, $s_i$, has length $l_i$. Then $s_i$ is sorted by at most $l_i + 1$ counting sorts. (The ''+1'' is because it may have to be sorted as an empty string at some point; for example, ab and a end up in the same group in the first pass and are then ordered based on b and the empty string in the second pass. The string a is sorted its length, $1$, time plus one more time.) A call of counting sort on t strings takes $\\Theta(t)$ time (remembering that the number of different characters on which we are sorting is a constant.) Thus, the total time for all calls of counting sort is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nO\\Bigg(\\sum_{i = 1}^m (l_i + 1)\\Bigg)\n    & = O\\Bigg(\\sum_{i = 1}^m (l_i + m)\\Bigg) \\\\\n    & = O(n + m) \\\\\n    & = O(n),\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhere the second line follows from $\\sum_{i = 1}^m l_i = n$, and the last line is because $m \\le n$.",

Moreover, for every red jug, there is a blue jug that holds the same amount of water, and vice versa.\n\n\nYour task is to find a grouping of the jugs into pairs of red and blue jugs that hold the same amount of water. To do so, you may perform the following operation: pick a pair of jugs in which one is red and one is blue, fill the red jug with water, and then pour the water into the blue jug. This operation will tell you whether the red or the blue jug can hold more water, or that they have the same volume. Assume that such a comparison takes one time unit. Your goal is to find an algorithm that makes a minimum number of comparisons to determine the grouping. Remember that you may not directly compare two red jugs or two blue jugs.\n\n\na.\n Describe a deterministic algorithm that uses $\\Theta(n^2)$ comparisons to group the jugs into pairs.\n\n\nb.\n Prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(n\\lg n)$ for the number of comparisons that an algorithm solving this problem must make.\n\n\nc.\n Give a randomized algorithm whose expected number of comparisons is $O(n\\lg n)$, and prove that this bound is correct.

Since there are $n$ red jugs and $n$ blue jugs, that will take $\\Theta(n^2)$ comparisons in the worst case.\n\n\nb.\n To solve the problem, an algorithm has to perform a series of comparisons until it has enough information to determine the matching. We can view the computation of the algorithm in terms of a decision tree. Every internal node is labeled with two jugs (one red, one blue) which we compare, and has three outgoing edges (red jug smaller, same size, or larger than the blue jug). The leaves are labeled with a unique matching of jugs.\n\n\nThe height of the decision tree is equal to the worst-case number of comparisons the algorithm has to make to determine the matching. To bound that size, let us first compute the number of possible matchings for n red and n blue jugs.\n\n\nIf we label the red jugs from $1$ to $n$ and we also label the blue jugs from $1$ to $n$ before starting the comparisons, every outcome of the algorithm can be represented as a set\n\n\n$$\\text{{$i, \\pi(i): 1 \\le i \\le n$ and $\\pi$ is a permutation on {$1, \\ldots, n$}}},$$\n\n\nwhich contains the pairs of red jugs (first component) and blue jugs (second component) that are matched up. Since every permutation $\\pi$ corresponds to a different outcome, there must be exactly $n!$ different results.\n\n\nNow we can bound the height $h$ of our decision tree. Every tree with a branching factor of $3$ (every inner node has at most three children) has at most $3^h$ leaves. Since the decison tree must have at least $n!$ children, it follows that\n\n\n$$3^h \\ge n! \\ge (n / e)^n \\Rightarrow h \\ge n\\log_3 n - n\\log_3 e = \\Omega(n\\lg n).$$\n\n\nSo any algorithm solving the problem must use $\\Omega(n\\lg n)$ comparisons.\n\n\nc.\n Assume that the red jugs are labeled with numbers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ and so are the blue jugs. The numbers are arbitrary and do not correspond to the volumes of jugs, but are just used to refer to the jugs in the algorithm description. Moreover, the output of the algorithm will consist of $n$ distinct pairs $(i, j)$, where the red jug $i$ and the blue jug $j$ have the same volume.\n\n\nThe procedure $\\text{MATCH-JUGS}$ takes as input two sets representing jugs to be matched: $R \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, representing red jugs, and $B \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, representing blue jugs. We will call the procedure only with inputs that can be matched; one necessary condition is that $|R| = |B|$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nMATCH\n-\nJUGS\n(\nR\n,\n \nB\n)\n\n    \nif\n \n|\nR\n|\n \n==\n \n0\n         \n// sets are empty\n\n        \nreturn\n\n    \nif\n \n|\nR\n|\n \n==\n \n1\n         \n// sets contain just one jug each\n\n        \nlet\n \nR\n \n=\n \n{\nr\n}\n \nand\n \nB\n \n=\n \n{\nb\n}\n\n        \noutput\n \n\"(r, b)\"\n\n        \nreturn\n\n    \nelse\n \nr\n \n=\n \na\n \nrandomly\n \nchosen\n \njug\n \nin\n \nR\n\n        \ncompare\n \nr\n \nto\n \nevery\n \njug\n \nof\n \nB\n\n        \nB\n<\n \n=\n \nthe\n \nset\n \nof\n \njugs\n \nin\n \nB\n \nthat\n \nare\n \nsmaller\n \nthan\n \nr\n \n        \nB\n>\n \n=\n \nthe\n \nset\n \nof\n \njugs\n \nin\n \nB\n \nthat\n \nare\n \nlarger\n \nthan\n \nr\n \n        \nb\n \n=\n \nthe\n \none\n \njug\n \nin\n \nB\n \nwith\n \nthe\n \nsame\n \nsize\n \nas\n \nr\n \n        \ncompare\n \nb\n \nto\n \nevery\n \njug\n \nof\n \nR\n \n-\n \n{\nr\n}\n\n        \nR\n<\n \n=\n \nthe\n \nset\n \nof\n \njugs\n \nin\n \nR\n \nthat\n \nare\n \nsmaller\n \nthan\n \nb\n\n        \nR\n>\n \n=\n \nthe\n \nset\n \nof\n \njugs\n \nin\n \nR\n \nthat\n \nare\n \nlarger\n \nthan\n \nb\n \n        \noutput\n \n\"(r, b)\"\n\n        \nMATCH\n-\nJUGS\n(\nR\n,\n \nB\n>\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrectness can be seen as follows (remember that $|R| = |B|$ in each call). Once we pick $r$ randomly from $R$, there will be a matching among the jugs in volume smaller than $r$ (which are in the sets $R_<$ and $B_<$), and likewise between the jugs larger than $r$ (which are in $R_>$ and $B_>$). Termination is also easy to see: since $|R_<| + |R_>| < |R|$ in every recursive step, the size of the first parameter reduces with every recursive call. It eventually must reach $0$ or $1$, in which case the recursion terminates.\n\n\nWhat about the running time? The analysis of the expected number of comparisons is similar to that of the quicksort algorithm in Section 7.4.2. Let us order the jugs as $r_1, \\ldots, r_n$ and $b_1, \\ldots,b_n$ where $r_i < r_{i + 1}$ and $b_i < b_{i + 1}$ for $i = 1, \\ldots, n$, and $r_i = b_i$. Our analysis uses indicator random variables\n\n\n$$X_{ij} = \\text I\\{\\text{red jug $r_i$ is compared to blue jug $b_j$}\\}.$$\n\n\nAs in quicksort, a given pair $r_i$ and $b_j$ is compared at most once. When we compare $r_i$ to every jug in $B$, jug $r_i$ will not be put in either $R_<$ or $R_>$. When we compare $b_i$ to every jug in $R - \\{r_i\\}$, jug $b_i$ is not put into either $B_<$ or $B_>$. The total number of comparisons is\n\n\n$$X = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ij}.$$\n\n\nTo calculate the expected value of $X$, we follow the quicksort analysis to arrive at\n\n\n$$\\text E[X] = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n \\Pr\\{r_i \\text{ is compared to } b_j\\}.$$\n\n\nAs in the quicksort analysis, once we choose a jug $r_k$ such that $r_i < r_k < b_j$, we will put $r_i$ in $R_<$ and $b_j$ in $R_>$, and so $r_i$ and $b_j$ will never be compared again. Let us denote $R_{ij} = \\{r_i, \\ldots, r_j\\}$. Then jugs $r_i$ and $b_j$ will be compared if and only if the first jug in $R_{ij}$ to be chosen is either $r_i$ or $r_j$.\n\n\nStill following the quicksort analysis, until a jug from $R_{ij}$ is chosen, the entire set $R_{ij}$ is together. Any jug in $R_{ij}$ is equally likely to be first one chosen. Since $|R_{ij}| = j - i + 1$, the probability of any given jug being the first one chosen in $R_{ij}$ is $1 / (j - i + 1)$. The remainder of the analysis is the same as the quicksort analysis, and we arrive at the solution of $O(n\\lg n)$ comparisons.\n\n\nJust like in quicksort, in the worst case we always choose the largest (or smallest) jug to partition the sets, which reduces the set sizes by only $1$. The running time then obeys the recurrence $T(n) = T(n - 1) + \\Theta(n)$, and the number of comparisons we make in the worst case is $T(n) = \\Theta(n^2)$.",

The indices of the positions compared in the sequence must be determined in advance, and although they can depend on the number of elements being sorted, they cannot depend on the values being sorted, nor can they depend on the result of any prior compare-exchange operation.

It states that if an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm correctly sorts all input sequences consisting of only $0$s and $1$s, then it correctly sorts all inputs containing arbitrary values.\n\n\nYou will prove the $0$-$1$ sorting lemma by proving its contrapositive: if an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm fails to sort an input containing arbitrary values, then it fails to sort some $0$-$1$ input. Assume that an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm $\\text X$ fails to correctly sort the array $A[1..n]$. Let $A[p]$ be the smallest value in $A$ that algorithm $\\text X$ puts into the wrong location, and let $A[q]$ be the value that algorithm $\\text X$ moves to the location into which $A[p]$ should have gone. Define an array $B[1..n]$ of $0$s and $1$s as follows:\n\n\n$$\nB[i] =\n\\begin{cases}\n    0 & \\text{if $A[i] \\le A[p]$}, \\\\\n    1 & \\text{if $A[i] >   A[p]$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\na.\n Argue that $A[q] > A[p]$, so that $B[p] = 0$ and $B[q] = 1$.\n\n\nb.\n To complete the proof of the $0$-$1$ sorting lemma, prove that algorithm $\\text X$ fails to sort array $B$ correctly.\n\n\nNow you will use the $0$-$1$ sorting lemma to prove that a particular sorting algorithm works correctly. The algorithm, \ncolumnsort\n, works on a rectangular array of $n$ elements. The array has $r$ rows and $s$ columns (so that $n = rs$), subject to three restrictions:\n\n\n\n\n$r$ must be even,\n\n\n$s$ must be a divisor of $r$, and\n\n\n$r \\ge 2 s^2$.\n\n\n\n\nWhen columnsort completes, the array is sorted in \ncolumn-major order\n: reading down the columns, from left to right, the elements monotonically increase.\n\n\nColumnsort operates in eight steps, regardless of the value of $n$. The odd steps are all the same: sort each column individually. Each even step is a fixed permutation. Here are the steps:\n\n\n\n\nSort each column.\n\n\nTranspose the array, but reshape it back to $r$ rows and $s$ columns. In other words, turn the leftmost column into the top $r / s$ rows, in order; turn the next column into the next $r / s$ rows, in order; and so on.\n\n\nSort each column.\n\n\nPerform the inverse of the permutation performed in step 2.\n\n\nSort each column.\n\n\nShift the top half of each column into the bottom half of the same column, and shift the bottom half of each column into the top half of the next column to the right. Leave the top half of the leftmost column empty. Shift the bottom half of the last column into the top half of a new rightmost column, and leave the bottom half of this new column empty.\n\n\nSort each column.\n\n\nPerform the inverse of the permutation performed in step 6.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5 shows an example of the steps of columnsort with $r = 6$ and $s = 3$. (Even though this example violates the requirement that $r \\ge 2s^2$, it happens to work.)\n\n\nc.\n Argue that we can treat columnsort as an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm, even if we do not know what sorting method the odd steps use.\n\n\nAlthough it might seem hard to believe that columnsort actually sorts, you will use the $0$-$1$ sorting lemma to prove that it does. The $0$-$1$ sorting lemma applies because we can treat columnsort as an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm. A couple of definitions will help you apply the $0$-$1$ sorting lemma. We say that an area of an array is \nclean\n if we know that it contains either all $0$s or all $1$s. Otherwise, the area might contain mixed $0$s and $1$s, and it is \ndirty\n. From here on, assume that the input array contains only $0$s and $1$s, and that we can treat it as an array with $r$ rows and $s$ columns.\n\n\nd.\n Prove that after steps 1\u20133, the array consists of some clean rows of $0$s at the top, some clean rows of $1$s at the bottom, and at most $s$ dirty rows between them.\n\n\ne.\n Prove that after step 4, the array, read in column - major order, starts with a clean area of $0$s, ends with a clean area of $1$s, and has a dirty area of at most $s^2$ elements in the middle.\n\n\nf.\n Prove that steps 5\u20138 produce a fully sorted $0$-$1$ output. Conclude that columnsort correctly sorts all inputs containing arbitrary values.\n\n\ng.\n Now suppose that $s$ does not divide $r$. Prove that after steps 1\u20133, the array consists of some clean rows of $0$s at the top, some clean rows of $1$s at the bottom, and at most $2s - 1$ dirty rows between them. How large must $r$ be, compared with $s$, for columnsort to correctly sort when $s$ does not divide $r$?\n\n\nh.\n Suggest a simple change to step 1 that allows us to maintain the requirement that $r \\ge 2s^2$ even when $s$ does not divide $r$, and prove that with your change, columnsort correctly sorts.\n\n\n\n\na.\n $A[q]$ must go the wrong place, because it goes where $A[p]$ should go. Since $A[p]$ is the smallest value in array $A$ that goes to the wrong array location, $A[p]$ must be smaller than $A[q]$.\n\n\nb.\n From how we have defined the array $B$, we have that if $A[i] \\le A[j]$ then $B[i] \\le B[j]$. Therefore, algorithm $\\text X$ performs the same sequence of exchanges on array $B$ as it does on array $A$. The output produced on array $A$ is of the form $\\ldots A[q] \\ldots A[p] \\ldots$, and so the output produced on array $B$ is of the form $\\ldots B[q] \\ldots B[p] \\ldots$, or $\\ldots 1 \\ldots 0 \\ldots$. Hence algorithm $\\text X$ fails to sort array $B$ correctly.\n\n\nc.\n The even steps perform fixed permutations. The odd steps sort each column by some sorting algorithm, which might not be an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm. But the result of sorting each column would be the same as if we did use an oblivious compare-exchange algorithm.\n\n\nd.\n After step 1, each column has $0$s on top and $1$s on the bottom, with at most one transition between $0$s and $1$s, and it is a $0 \\to 1$ transition. (As we read the array in column - major order, all $1 \\to 0$ transitions occur between adjacent columns.) After step 2, therefore, each consecutive group of $r / s$ rows, read in row-major order, has at most one transition, and again it is a $0 \\to 1$ transition. All $1 \\to 0$ transitions occur at the end of a group of $r / s$ rows. Since there are s groups of $r / s$ rows, there are at most $s$ dirty rows, and the rest of the rows are clean. Step 3 moves the $0$s to the top rows and the $1$s to the bottom rows. The $s$ dirty rows are somewhere in the middle.\n\n\ne.\n The dirty area after step 3 is at most $s$ rows high and $s$ columns wide, and so its area is at most $s^2$. Step 4 turns the clean $0$s in the top rows into a clean area on the left, the clean $1$s in the bottom rows into a clean area on the right, and the dirty area of size $s^2$ is between the two clean areas.\n\n\nf.\n First, we argue that if the dirty area after step 4 has size at most $r / 2$, then steps 5\u20138 complete the sorting. If the dirty area has size at most $r / 2$ (half a column), then it either resides entirely in one column or it resides in the bottom half of one column and the top half of the next column. In the former case, step 5 sorts the column containing the dirty area, and steps 6\u20138 maintain that the array is sorted. In the latter case, step 5 cannot increase the size of the dirty area, step 6 moves the entire dirty area into the same column, step 7 sorts it, and step 8 moves it back.\n\n\nSecond, we argue that the dirty area after step 4 has size at most $r / 2$. But that follows immediately from the requirement that $r \\ge 2s^2$ and the property that after step 4, the dirty area has size at most $s^2$.\n\n\ng.\n If $s$ does not divide $r$, then after step 2, we can see up to $s$ $0 \\to 1$ transitions and $s - 1$ $1 \\to 0$ transitions in the rows. After step 3, we would have up to $2s - 1$ dirty rows, for a dirty area size of at most $2s^2 - s$. To push the correctness proof through, we need $2s^2 - s \\le r / 2$, or $r \\ge 4s^2 - 2s$.\n\n\nh.\n We can reduce the number of transitions in the rows after step 2 back down to at most $s$ by sorting every other column in reverse order in step 1. Now if we have a transition (either $1 \\to 0$ or $0 \\to 1$) between columns after step 1, then either one of the columns had all $1$s or the other had all $0$s, in which case we would not have a transition within one of the columns.",

At most $\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil$ (the height of the tree of comparisons) elements were compared with the smallest, so finding the smallest of these takes $\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil - 1$ comparisons in the worst case.  The total number of comparisons made in the two tournaments was  $$n - 1 + \\lceil \\lg n \\rceil - 1 = n + \\lceil \\lg n \\rceil - 2$$  in the worst case.",

Give an $O(\\lg n)$-time algorithm to find the median of all $2n$ elements in arrays $X$ and $Y$.\n\n\n\n\nLet's start out by supposing that the median (the lower median, since we know we have an even number of elements) is in $X$. Let's call the median value $m$, and let's suppose that it's in $X[k]$. Then $k$ elements of $X$ are less than or equal to $m$ and $n - k$ elements of X are greater than or equal to m. We know that in the two arrays combined, there must be $n$ elements less than or equal to $m$ and $n$ elements greater than or equal to $m$, and so there must be $n - k$ elements of $Y$ that are less than or equal to $m$ and $n - (n - k)=k$ elements of $Y$ that are greater than or equal to $m$.\n\n\nThus, we can check that $X[k]$ is the lower median by checking whether $Y[n - k] \\le X[k] \\le Y[n - k + 1]$. A boundary case occurs for $k = n$. Then $n - k = 0$, and there is no array entry $Y[0]$; we only need to check that $X[n] \\le Y[1]$.\n\n\nNow, if the median is in $X$ but is not in $X[k]$, then the above condition will not hold. If the median is in $X[k']$ , where $k' < k$, then $X[k]$ is above the median, and $Y[n - k + 1] < X[k]$. Conversely, if the median is in $X[k'']$, where $k'' > k$, then $X[k]$ is below the median, and $X[k] < Y[n - k]$.\n\n\nThus, we can use a binary search to determine whether there is an $X[k]$ such that either $k < n$ and $X[n - k] \\le Y[k] \\le X[n - k + 1]$ or $k = n$ and $X[k] \\le Y[n - k + 1]$; if we find such an $X[k]$, then it is the median. Otherwise, we know that the median is in $Y$, and we use a binary search to find a $Y[k]$ such that either $k < n$ and $X[n - k] \\le Y[k] \\le X[n - k + 1]$ or $k = n$ is the median. Since each binary search takes $O(\\lg n)$ time, we spend a total of $O(\\lg n)$ time.\n\n\nHere's how we write the algorithm in pseudocode:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nTWO\n-\nARRAY\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nX\n,\n \nY\n)\n\n    \nn\n \n=\n \nX\n.\nlength\n        \n// n also equals Y.length\n\n    \nmedian\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nX\n,\n \nY\n,\n \nn\n,\n \n1\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nmedian\n \n==\n \nNOT\n-\nFOUND\n\n        \nmedian\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nY\n,\n \nX\n,\n \nn\n,\n \n1\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nmedian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nFIND\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nA\n,\n \nB\n,\n \nn\n,\n \nlow\n,\n \nhign\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nlow\n \n>\n \nhigh\n\n        \nreturn\n \nNOT\n-\nFOUND\n\n    \nelse\n \nk\n \n=\n \nfloor\n((\nlow\n \n+\n \nhigh\n)\n \n/\n \n2\n)\n\n        \nif\n \nk\n \n==\n \nn\n \nand\n \nA\n[\nn\n]\n \n\u2264\n \nB\n[\n1\n]\n\n            \nreturn\n \nA\n[\nn\n]\n\n        \nelse\n \nif\n \nk\n \n<\n \nn\n \nand\n \nB\n[\nn\n \n-\n \nk\n]\n \n\u2264\n \nA\n[\nk\n]\n \n\u2264\n \nB\n[\nn\n \n-\n \nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n\n            \nreturn\n \nA\n[\nk\n]\n\n        \nelse\n \nA\n[\nk\n]\n \n>\n \nB\n[\nn\n \n-\n \nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n\n            \nreturn\n \nFIND\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nA\n,\n \nB\n,\n \nn\n,\n \nlow\n,\n \nk\n \n-\n \n1\n)\n\n        \nelse\n \nreturn\n \nFIND\n-\nMEDIAN\n(\nA\n,\n \nB\n,\n \nn\n,\n \nk\n \n+\n \n1\n,\n \nhigh\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3-9\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running east to west through an oil field of $n$ wells. The company wants to connect a spur pipeline from each well directly to the main pipeline along a shortest route (either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.2. Given the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal location of the main pipeline, which would be the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs? Show how to determine the optimal location in linear time.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to find the optimal placement for Professor Olay's pipeline, we need only find the median(s) of the $y$-coordinates of his oil wells, as the following proof explains.\n\n\nClaim\n \n\n\nThe optimal $y$-coordinate for Professor Olay's east-west oil pipeline is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIf $n$ is even, then on either the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the lower median or the one whose $y$-coordinate is the upper median, or anywhere between them.\n\n\nIf $n$ is odd, then on the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the median.\n\n\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nWe examine various cases. In each case, we will start out with the pipeline at a particular $y$-coordinate and see what happens when we move it. We'll denote by $s$ the sum of the north-south spurs with the pipeline at the starting location, and $s'$ will denote the sum after moving the pipeline.\n\n\nWe start with the case in which n is even. Let us start with the pipeline somewhere on or between the two oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are the lower and upper medians. If we move the pipeline by a vertical distance $d$ without crossing either of the median wells, then $n / 2$ of the wells become $d$ farther from the pipeline and $n / 2$ become $d$ closer, and so $s' = s + dn / 2 - dn / 2 = s$; thus, all locations on or between the two medians are equally good.\n\n\nNow suppose that the pipeline goes through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the upper median. What happens when we increase the $y$-coordinate of the pipeline by $d > 0$ units, so that it moves above the oil well that achieves the upper median? All oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are at or below the upper median become d units farther from the pipeline, and there are at least $n / 2 + 1$ such oil wells (the upper median, and every well at or below the lower median). There are at most $n / 2 - 1$ oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are above the upper median, and each of these oil wells becomes at most d units closer to the pipeline when it moves up. Thus, we have a lower bound on $s'$ of $s' \\ge s + d(n / 2 + 1) - d(n / 2 - 1) = s + 2d > s$. We conclude that moving the pipeline up from the oil well at the upper median increases the total spur length. A symmetric argument shows that if we start with the pipeline going through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the lower median and move it down, then the total spur length increases.\n\n\nWe see, therefore, that when $n$ is even, an optimal placement of the pipeline is anywhere on or between the two medians.\n\n\nNow we consider the case when $n$ is odd. We start with the pipeline going through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the median, and we consider what happens when we move it up by $d > 0$ units. All oil wells at or below the median become $d$ units farther from the pipeline, and there are at least $(n + 1) / 2$ such wells (the one at the median and the $(n - 1) / 2$ at or below the median. There are at most $(n - 1) / 2$ oil wells above the median, and each of these becomes at most d units closer to the pipeline. We get a lower bound on $s'$ of $s' \\ge s + d(n + 1) / 2 - d(n - 1) / 2 = s + d > s$, and we conclude that moving the pipeline up from the oil well at the median increases the total spur length. A symmetric argument shows that moving the pipeline down from the median also increases the total spur length, and so the optimal placement of the pipeline is on the median. (claim)\n\n\nSince we know we are looking for the median, we can use the linear-time median-finding algorithm.",

Argue that $\\text{SELECT}$ does not run in linear time if groups of $3$ are used.   For groups of $7$, the algorithm still works in linear time. The number of elements greater than $x$ (and similarly, the number less than $x$) is at least  $$4\\Bigg(\\Bigg\\lceil \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\lceil \\frac{n}{7} \\Big\\rceil\\Bigg\\rceil - 2\\Bigg) \\ge \\frac{2n}{7} - 8,$$  and the recurrence becomes  $$T(n) \\le T(\\lceil n/7 \\rceil) + T(5n/7 + 8) + O(n),$$  which can be shown to be $O(n)$ by substitution, as for the groups of $5$ case in the text.  For groups of $3$, however, the algorithm no longer works in linear time. The number of elements greater than $x$, and the number of elements less than $x$, is at least  $$2\\Bigg(\\Bigg\\lceil \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\lceil \\frac{n}{3} \\Big\\rceil\\Bigg\\rceil - 2\\Bigg) \\ge \\frac{n}{3} - 4,$$  and the recurrence becomes  $$T(n) \\le T(\\lceil n / 3 \\rceil) + T(2n / 3 + 4) + O(n),$$  which does not have a linear solution.  We can prove that the worst-case time for groups of $3$ is \u007f$\\Omega(n\\lg n)$. We do so by deriving a recurrence for a particular case that takes \u007f$\\Omega(n\\lg n)$ time.  In counting up the number of elements greater than $x$ (and similarly, the number less than $x$), consider the particular case in which there are exactly $\\Big\\lceil \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\lceil \\frac{n}{3} \\Big\\rceil\\Big\\rceil$ groups with medians $\\ge x$ and in which the \"leftover\" group does contribute 2 elements greater than $x$. Then the number of elements greater than $x$ is exactly $2\\Big(\\Big\\lceil \\frac{1}{2} \\Big\\lceil \\frac{n}{3} \\Big\\rceil\\Big\\rceil - 1\\Big) + 1$ (the $-1$ discounts $x$'s group, as usual, and the $+1$ is contributed by $x$'s group) $= 2\\lceil n / 6 \\rceil - 1$, and the recursive step for elements $\\le x$ has $n - (2 \\lceil n / 6 \\rceil - 1) \\ge n - (2(n / 6 + 1) - 1) = 2n / 3 - 1$ elements. Observe also that the $O(n)$ term in the recurrence is really $\\Theta(n)$, since the partitioning in step 4 takes $\\Theta(n)$ (not just $O(n)$) time. Thus, we get the recurrence  \\begin{align}\nT(n) & \\ge T(\\lceil n / 3 \\rceil) + T(2n / 3 - 1) + \\Theta(n) \\\\\n     & \\ge T(n / 3) + T(2n / 3 - 1) + \\Theta(n),\n\\end{align}  from which you can show that $T(n) \\ge cn\\lg n$ by substitution. You can also see that $T(n)$ is nonlinear by noticing that each level of the recursion tree sums to $n$.  [In fact, any odd group size $\\ge 5$ works in linear time.]",

Give an $O(\\lg n)$-time algorithm to find the median of all $2n$ elements in arrays $X$ and $Y$.   Let's start out by supposing that the median (the lower median, since we know we have an even number of elements) is in $X$. Let's call the median value $m$, and let's suppose that it's in $X[k]$. Then $k$ elements of $X$ are less than or equal to $m$ and $n - k$ elements of X are greater than or equal to m. We know that in the two arrays combined, there must be $n$ elements less than or equal to $m$ and $n$ elements greater than or equal to $m$, and so there must be $n - k$ elements of $Y$ that are less than or equal to $m$ and $n - (n - k)=k$ elements of $Y$ that are greater than or equal to $m$.  Thus, we can check that $X[k]$ is the lower median by checking whether $Y[n - k] \\le X[k] \\le Y[n - k + 1]$. A boundary case occurs for $k = n$. Then $n - k = 0$, and there is no array entry $Y[0]$; we only need to check that $X[n] \\le Y[1]$.  Now, if the median is in $X$ but is not in $X[k]$, then the above condition will not hold. If the median is in $X[k']$ , where $k' < k$, then $X[k]$ is above the median, and $Y[n - k + 1] < X[k]$. Conversely, if the median is in $X[k'']$, where $k'' > k$, then $X[k]$ is below the median, and $X[k] < Y[n - k]$.  Thus, we can use a binary search to determine whether there is an $X[k]$ such that either $k < n$ and $X[n - k] \\le Y[k] \\le X[n - k + 1]$ or $k = n$ and $X[k] \\le Y[n - k + 1]$; if we find such an $X[k]$, then it is the median. Otherwise, we know that the median is in $Y$, and we use a binary search to find a $Y[k]$ such that either $k < n$ and $X[n - k] \\le Y[k] \\le X[n - k + 1]$ or $k = n$ is the median.

            "text": "Professor Olay is consulting for an oil company, which is planning a large pipeline running east to west through an oil field of $n$ wells. The company wants to connect a spur pipeline from each well directly to the main pipeline along a shortest route (either north or south), as shown in Figure 9.2. Given the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the wells, how should the professor pick the optimal location of the main pipeline, which would be the one that minimizes the total length of the spurs? Show how to determine the optimal location in linear time.   In order to find the optimal placement for Professor Olay's pipeline, we need only find the median(s) of the $y$-coordinates of his oil wells, as the following proof explains.  Claim    The optimal $y$-coordinate for Professor Olay's east-west oil pipeline is as follows:   If $n$ is even, then on either the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the lower median or the one whose $y$-coordinate is the upper median, or anywhere between them.  If $n$ is odd, then on the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the median.   Proof    We examine various cases. In each case, we will start out with the pipeline at a particular $y$-coordinate and see what happens when we move it. We'll denote by $s$ the sum of the north-south spurs with the pipeline at the starting location, and $s'$ will denote the sum after moving the pipeline.  We start with the case in which n is even. Let us start with the pipeline somewhere on or between the two oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are the lower and upper medians. If we move the pipeline by a vertical distance $d$ without crossing either of the median wells, then $n / 2$ of the wells become $d$ farther from the pipeline and $n / 2$ become $d$ closer, and so $s' = s + dn / 2 - dn / 2 = s$; thus, all locations on or between the two medians are equally good.  Now suppose that the pipeline goes through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the upper median. What happens when we increase the $y$-coordinate of the pipeline by $d > 0$ units, so that it moves above the oil well that achieves the upper median? All oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are at or below the upper median become d units farther from the pipeline, and there are at least $n / 2 + 1$ such oil wells (the upper median, and every well at or below the lower median). There are at most $n / 2 - 1$ oil wells whose $y$-coordinates are above the upper median, and each of these oil wells becomes at most d units closer to the pipeline when it moves up. Thus, we have a lower bound on $s'$ of $s' \\ge s + d(n / 2 + 1) - d(n / 2 - 1) = s + 2d > s$. We conclude that moving the pipeline up from the oil well at the upper median increases the total spur length. A symmetric argument shows that if we start with the pipeline going through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the lower median and move it down, then the total spur length increases.  We see, therefore, that when $n$ is even, an optimal placement of the pipeline is anywhere on or between the two medians.  Now we consider the case when $n$ is odd. We start with the pipeline going through the oil well whose $y$-coordinate is the median, and we consider what happens when we move it up by $d > 0$ units. All oil wells at or below the median become $d$ units farther from the pipeline, and there are at least $(n + 1) / 2$ such wells (the one at the median and the $(n - 1) / 2$ at or below the median. There are at most $(n - 1) / 2$ oil wells above the median, and each of these becomes at most d units closer to the pipeline. We get a lower bound on $s'$ of $s' \\ge s + d(n + 1) / 2 - d(n - 1) / 2 = s + d > s$, and we conclude that moving the pipeline up from the oil well at the median increases the total spur length. A symmetric argument shows that moving the pipeline down from the median also increases the total spur length, and so the optimal placement of the pipeline is on the median. (claim)  Since we know we are looking for the median, we can use the linear-time median-finding algorithm.",

Then we scan the array of sorted $x_i$'s, starting with the smallest element and accumulating weights as we scan, until the total exceeds $1 / 2$. The last element, say $x_k$, whose weight caused the total to exceed $1 / 2$, is the weighted median. Notice that the total weight of all elements smaller than $x_k$ is less than $1 / 2$, because $x_k$ was the first element that caused the total weight to exceed $1 / 2$. Similarly, the total weight of all elements larger than $x_k$ is also less than $1 / 2$, because the total weight of all the other elements exceeds $1 / 2$.\n\n\nThe sorting phase can be done in $O(n\\lg n)$ worst-case time (using merge sort or heapsort), and the scanning phase takes $O(n)$ time. The total running time in the worst case, therefore, is $O(n\\lg n)$.\n\n\nc.\n We find the weighted median in $\\Theta(n)$ worst-case time using the $\\Theta(n)$ worst-case median algorithm in Section 9.3. (Although the first paragraph of the section only claims an $O(n)$ upper bound, it is easy to see that the more precise running time of $\\Theta(n)$ applies as well, since steps 1, 2, and 4 of $\\text{SELECT}$ actually take $\\Theta(n)$ time.)\n\n\nThe weighted-median algorithm works as follows. If $n \\le 2$, we just return the brute-force solution. Otherwise, we proceed as follows. We find the actual median $x_k$ of the $n$ elements and then partition around it. We then compute the total weights of the two halves. If the weights of the two halves are each strictly less than $1 / 2$, then the weighted median is $x_k$ . Otherwise, the weighted median should be in the half with total weight exceeding $1 / 2$. The total weight of the \"light\" half is lumped into the weight of $x_k$ , and the search continues within the half that weighs more than $1 / 2$.

We show the optimality of the weighted median $x$ by showing that $f(y) - f(x) \\ge 0$. We examine separately the cases in which $y > x$ and $x > y$. For any $x$ and $y$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf(y) - f(x) & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |y - x_i| - \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |x - x_i| \\\\\n            & = \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i (|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWhen $y > x$, we bound the quantity $|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|$ from below by examining three cases:\n\n\n\n\n$x < y \\le x_i$: Here, $|x - y| + |y - x_i| = |x - x_i|$ and $|x - y| = y - x$, which imply that $|y - x_i| - |x - x_i| = -|x - y| = x - y$.\n\n\n$x < x_i \\le y$: Here, $|y - x_i| \\ge 0$ and $|x_i - x| \\le y - x$, which imply that $|y - x_i| - |x - x_i| \\ge -(y - x) = x - y$.\n\n\n$x_i \\le x < y$: Here, $|x - x_i| + |y - x| = |y - x_i|$ and $|y - x| = y - x$, which imply that $y - x_i| - |x - x_i| = |y - x| = y - x$.\n\n\n\n\nSeparating out the first two cases, in which $x < x_i$, from the third case, in which $x \\ge x_i$, we get\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf(y) - f(x) & =   \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(|y - x_i| - |x - x_i|) \\\\\n            & \\ge \\sum_{x < x_i} w_i (x - y) + \\sum_{x \\ge x_i} w_i (y - x) \\\\\n            & =   (y - x) \\Bigg(\\sum_{x \\ge x_i} w_i - \\sum_{x < x_i} w_i \\Bigg).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThe property that $\\sum_{x_i < x} w_i < 1 / 2$ implies that $\\sum_{x \\ge x_i} w_i \\ge 1 / 2$.

This fact, combined with $x - y > 0$ and $\\sum_{x > x_i} w_i < 1 / 2$, yields that $f(y) - f(x) > 0$.\n\n\ne.\n We are given $n$ $2$-dimensional points $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$, where each $p_i$ is a pair of real numbers $p_i = (x_i, y_i)$, and positive weights $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n$. The goal is to find a point $p = (x, y)$ that minimizes the sum\n\n\n$$f(x, y) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i(|x - x_i| + |y - y_i|).$$\n\n\nWe can express the cost function of the two variables, $f(x, y)$, as the sum of two functions of one variable each: $f(x, y) = g(x) + h(y)$, where $g(x) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |x - x_i|$, and $h(y) = \\sum_{i = 1}^n w_i |y - y_i|$. The goal of finding a point $p = (x, y)$ that minimizes the value of $f(x, y)$ can be achieved by treating each dimension independently, because $g$ does not depend on $y$ and $h$ does not depend on $x$. Thus,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\min_{x, y} f(x, y)\n    & = \\min_{x, y} (g(x) + h(y)) \\\\\n    & = \\min_x \\Big(\\min_y(g(x) + h(y))\\Big) \\\\\n    & = \\min_x \\Big(g(x) + \\min_y h(y)\\Big) \\\\\n    & = \\min_x g(x) + \\min_y h(y).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nConsequently, finding the best location in $2$ dimensions can be done by finding the weighted median $x_k$ of the $x$-coordinates and then finding the weighted median $y_j$ of the $y$-coordinates. The point $(x_k, y_j)$ is an optimal solution for the $2$-dimensional post-office location problem.",

When $i$ is small relative to $n$, we can implement a different procedure that uses $\\text{SELECT}$ as a subroutine but makes fewer comparisons in the worst case.\n\n\na.\n Describe an algorithm that uses $U_i(n)$ comparisons to find the $i$th smallest of $n$ elements, where\n\n\n$$\nU_i(n) = \n\\begin{cases} \nT(n) & \\text{if $i \\ge n / 2$}, \\\\\n\\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor + U_i(\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil) + T(2i) & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n($\\textit{Hint:}$ Begin with $\\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor$ disjoint pairwise comparisons, and recurse on the set containing the smaller element from each pair.)\n\n\nb.\n Show that, if $i < n / 2$, then $U_i(n) = n + O(T(2i)\\lg(n / i))$.\n\n\nc.\n Show that if $i$ is a constant less than $n / 2$, then $U_i(n) = n + O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nd.\n Show that if $i = n / k$ for $k \\ge 2$, then $U_i(n) = n + O(T(2n / k)\\lg k)$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Our algorithm relies on a particular property of $\\text{SELECT}$: that not only does it return the $i$th smallest element, but that it also partitions the input array so that the first $i$ positions contain the $i$ smallest elements (though not necessarily in sorted order). To see that $\\text{SELECT}$ has this property, observe that there are only two ways in which returns a value: when $n = 1$, and when immediately after partitioning in step 4, it finds that there are exactly $i$ elements on the low side of the partition.\n\n\nTaking the hint from the book, here is our modified algorithm to select the $i$th smallest element of $n$ elements. Whenever it is called with $i \\ge n / 2$, it just calls $\\text{SELECT}$ and returns its result; in this case, $U_i(n) = T(n)$.\n\n\nWhen $i < n / 2$, our modified algorithm works as follows. Assume that the input is in a subarray $A[p + 1..p + n]$, and let $m = \\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor$. In the initial call, $p = 1$.\n\n\n\n\nDivide the input as follows. If $n$ is even, divide the input into two parts: $A[p + 1..p + m]$ and $A[p + m + 1..p + n]$. If $n$ is odd, divide the input into three parts: $A[p + 1..p + m]$, $A[p + m + 1..p + n - 1]$, and $A[p + n]$ as a leftover piece.\n\n\nCompare $A[p + i]$ and $A[p + i + m]$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$, putting the smaller of the the two elements into $A[p + i + m]$ and the larger into $A[p + i]$.\n\n\nRecursively find the $i$th smallest element in $A[p + m + 1..p + n]$, but with an additional action performed by the partitioning procedure: whenever it exchanges $A[j]$  and $A[k]$ (where $p + m + 1 \\le j$, $k \\le p + 2m$), it also exchanges $A[j - m]$ and $A[k - m]$. The idea is that after recursively finding the $i$th smallest element in $A[p + m + 1..p + n]$, the subarray $A[p + m + 1..p + m + i]$ contains the $i$ smallest elements that had been in $A[p + m + 1..p + n]$ and the subarray $A[p + 1..p + i]$ contains their larger counterparts, as found in step 1. The ith smallest element of $A[p + 1..p + n]$ must be either one of the $i$ smallest, as placed into $A[p + m + 1..p + m + i]$, or it must be one of the larger counterparts, as placed into $A[p + 1..p + i]$.\n\n\nCollect the subarrays $A[p + 1..p + i]$ and $A[p + m + 1..p + m + i]$ into a single array $B[1..2i]$, call $\\text{SELECT}$ to find the ith smallest element of $B$, and return the result of this call to $\\text{SELECT}$.\n\n\n\n\nThe number of comparisons in each step is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNo comparisons.\n\n\n$m = \\lfloor n / 2 \\lfloor$ comparisons.\n\n\nSince we recurse on $A[p + m + 1..p + n]$, which has $dn / 2e$ elements, the number of comparisons is $U_i(\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil)$.\n\n\nSince we call $\\text{SELECT}$ on an array with $2i$ elements, the number of comparisons is $T(2i)$.\n\n\n\n\nThus, when $i < n / 2$, the total number of comparisons is $\\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor + U_i(\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil) + T(2i)$.\n\n\nb.\n We show by substitution that if $i < n / 2$, then $U_i(n) = n + O(T(2i)\\lg(n / i))$.

There can be another reason that $z_i$ and $z_j$ might not be compared, however. Suppose that $k < i$, so that $z_k < z_i$ , and suppose further that the element chosen as the pivot is $z_l$, where $k \\le l < i$. In this case, because $k \\le l$, the recursion won't consider elements indexed higher than $l$. Therefore, the recursion will never look at $z_i$ or $z_j$ , and they will never be compared with each other. Similarly, if $j < k$ and the pivot element $z_l$ is such that $j < l \\le k$, then the recursion won't consider elements indexed less than $l$, and again $z_i$ and $z_j$ will never be compared with each other. The final case is when $i \\le k \\le j$ (but disallowing $i = j$), so that $z_i \\le z_k \\le z_j$; in this case, we have the same analysis as for quicksort: $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared with each other only if one of them is chosen as the pivot element.\n\n\nGetting back to the case in which $k < i$, it is again true that $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared with each other only if one of them is chosen as the pivot element. As we know, they won't be compared with each other if the pivot element is between them, and we argued above that they won't be compared with each other if the pivot element is $z_l$ for $l < i$. Similarly, when $j < k$, elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared with each other only if one of them is chosen as the pivot element.\n\n\nNow we need to compute the probability that $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared with each other. Let $Z_{ijk}$ be the set of elements that includes $z_i, \\ldots, z_j$, along with $z_k, \\ldots, z_{i - 1}$ if $k < i$ or $z_{j + 1}, \\ldots, z_k$ if $j < k$. In other words,\n\n\n$$\nZ_{ijk} =\n\\begin{cases}\n{z_i, z_{i + 1}, \\ldots, z_j} & \\text{if $i \\le k \\le j$}, \\\\\n{z_k, z_{k + 1}, \\ldots, z_j} & \\text{if $k < i$}, \\\\\n{z_i, z_{i + 1}, \\ldots, z_k} & \\text{if $j < k$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nWith this definition of $Z_{ijk}$, we have that\n\n\n$$|Z_{ijk}| = \\max(j - i + 1, j - k + 1, k - i + 1).$$\n\n\nAs in the quicksort analysis, we observe that until an element from $Z_{ijk}$ is chosen as the pivot, the whole set $Z_{ijk}$ is together in the same partition, and so each element of $Z_{ijk}$ is equally likely to be the first one chosen as the pivot.\n\n\nLetting $C$ be the event that $z_i$ is compared with $z_j$ during the execution of the algorithm, we have that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X_{ijk}] \n    & = \\Pr\\{C\\} \\\\\n    & = \\Pr\\{z_i \\text{ or } z_j \\text{ is the first pivot chosen from } Z_{ijk}\\} \\\\\n    & = \\Pr\\{z_i \\text{ is the first pivot chosen from } Z_{ijk}\\} + \\Pr\\{z_j \\text{ is the first pivot chosen from } Z_{ijk}\\} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{1}{|Z_{ijk}|} + \\frac{1}{|Z_{ijk}|} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{2}{\\max(j - i + 1, j - k + 1, k - i + 1)}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nb.\n Adding up all the possible pairs that might be compared gives\n\n\n$$X_k = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ijk},$$\n\n\nand so, by linearity of expectation, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X_k]\n    & = \\text E \\Bigg[\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}\\sum_{j = i + 1}^n X_{ijk} \\Bigg] \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^n \\text E[X_{ijk}] \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^n \\frac{2}{\\max(j - i + 1, j - k + 1, k - i + 1)}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe break this sum into the same three cases as before: $i \\le k \\le j$, $k < i$ and $j < k$. With $k$ fixed, we vary $i$ and $j$. We get an inequality because we cannot have $i = k = j$, but our summation will allow it:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X_k]\n    & \\le 2\\Bigg(\\sum_{i = 1}^k \\sum_{j = k}^n \\frac{1}{j - i + 1} \n               + \\sum_{j = k + 1}^n \\sum_{i = k + 1}^{j - 1} \\frac{1}{j - k + 1} \n               + \\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 2} \\sum_{j = i + 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{k - i + 1}\\Bigg) \\\\\n    & =   2\\Bigg(\\sum_{i = 1}^k \\sum_{j = k}^n \\frac{1}{j - i + 1} \n               + \\sum_{j = k + 1}^n \\frac{j - k - 1}{j - k + 1} \n               + \\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 2} \\frac{k - i - 1}{k - i + 1}\\Bigg).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nc.\n First, let's focus on the latter two summations. Each one sums fractions that are strictly less than 1. The middle summation has $n - k$ terms, and the right-hand summation has $k - 2$ terms, and so the latter two summations sum to less than $n$.\n\n\nNow we look at the first summation. Let $m = j - i$. There is only one way for $m$ to equal $0$: if $i = k = j$. There are only two ways for $m$ to equal $1$: if $i = k - 1$ and $j = k$, or if $i = k$ and $j = k + 1$. There are only three ways for $m$ to equal $2$: if $i = k - 2$ and $j = k$, if $i = k - 1$ and $j = k + 1$, or if $i = k$ and $j = k + 2$. Continuing on, we see that there are at most $m + 1$ ways for $j - i$ to equal $m$. Since $j - i \\le n - 1$, we can rewrite the first summation as\n\n\n$$\\sum_{m = 0}^{n - 1} \\frac{m + 1}{m + 1} = n.$$\n\n\nThus, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[X_k]\n    & < 2(n + n) \\\\\n    & = 4n.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nd.\n To show that $\\text{RANDOMIZED-SELECT}$ runs in expected time $O(n)$, we adapt Lemma 7.1 for $\\text{RANDOMIZED-SELECT}$. The adaptation is trivial: just replace the variable $X$ in the lemma statement by the random variable $X_k$ that we just analyzed. Thus, the expected running time of $\\text{RANDOMIZED-SELECT}$ is $O(n + X_k) = O(n)$.",

Suppose further that of the $m$ items, exactly $n$ are on list $L$ and $m - n$ are on the free list. Write a procedure $\\text{COMPACTIFY-LIST}(L, F)$ that, given the list $L$ and the free list $F$, moves the items in $L$ so that they occupy array positions $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ and adjusts the free list $F$ so that it remains correct, occupying array positions $n + 1, n + 2, \\ldots, m$. The running time of your procedure should be $\\Theta(n)$, and it should use only a constant amount of extra space. Argue that your procedure is correct.

Show how to implement mergeable heaps using linked lists in each of the following cases. Try to make each operation as efficient as possible. Analyze the running time of each operation in terms of the size of the dynamic set(s) being operated on.\n\n\na.\n Lists are sorted.\n\n\nb.\n Lists are unsorted.\n\n\nc.\n Lists are unsorted, and dynamic sets to be merged are disjoint.\n\n\n\n\nIn all three cases, $\\text{MAKE-HEAP}$ simply creates a new list $L$, sets $L.head = \\text{NIL}$, and returns $L$ in constant time. Assume lists are doubly linked. To realize a linked list as a heap, we imagine the usual array implementation of a binary heap, where the children of the $i$th element are $2i$ and $2i + 1$.\n\n\na.\n To insert, we perform a linear scan to see where to insert an element such that the list remains sorted. This takes linear time. The first element in the list is the minimum element, and we can find it in constant time. $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ returns the first element of the list, then deletes it. Union performs a merge operation between the two sorted lists, interleaving their entries such that the resulting list is sorted. This takes time linear in the sum of the lengths of the two lists.\n\n\nb.\n To insert an element $x$ into the heap, begin linearly scanning the list until the first instance of an element $y$ which is strictly larger than $x$. If no such larger element exists, simply insert $x$ at the end of the list. If $y$ does exist, replace $y \\text t$ by $x$.\n\n\nThis maintains the min-heap property because $x \\le y$ and $y$ was smaller than each of its children, so $x$ must be as well. \n\n\nMoreover, $x$ is larger than its parent because $y$ was the first element in the list to exceed $x$. Now insert $y$, starting the scan at the node following $x$. Since we check each node at most once, the time is linear in the size of the list. \n\n\nTo get the minimum element, return the key of the head of the list in constant time.\n\n\nTo extract the minimum element, we first call $\\text{MINIMUM}$. Next, we'll replace the key of the head of the list by the key of the second smallest element $y$ in the list. We'll take the key stored at the end of the list and use it to replace the key of $y$. Finally, we'll delete the last element of the list, and call $\\text{MIN-HEAPIFY}$ on the list. \n\n\nTo implement this with linked lists, we need to step through the list to get from element $i$ to element $2i$. We omit this detail from the code, but we'll consider it for runtime analysis.

The search terminates once the index $i$ \"falls off\" the end of the list or once $key[i] \\ge k$. In the latter case, if $key[i] = k$, clearly we have found a key with the value $k$. If, however, $key[i] > k$, then we will never find a key with the value $k$, and so terminating the search was the right thing to do.\n\n\nLines 3\u20137 attempt to skip ahead to a randomly chosen position $j$. Such a skip benefits us if $key[j]$  is larger than $key[i]$ and no larger than $k$; in such a case, $j$ marks a position in the list that $i$ would have to reach during an ordinary list search. Because the list is compact, we know that any choice of $j$ between $1$ and $n$ indexes some object in the list rather than a slot on the free list.\n\n\nInstead of analyzing the performance of $\\text{COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH}$ directly, we shall analyze a related algorithm, $\\text{COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH}'$, which executes two separate loops.

So, we need to show that $\\Pr\\{X_t \\ge i\\} \\le (1 - i / n)^t$. This can be seen because having $X_t$ being greater than $i$ means that each random choice will result in an element that is either at least $i$ steps before the desired element, or is after the desired element. There are $n - i$ such elements, out of the total $n$ elements that we were pricking from. So, for a single one of the choices to be from such a range, we have a probability of $(n - i) / n = (1 - i / n)$. Since each of the selections was independent, the total probability that all of them were is $(1 - i / n)^t$, as desired. Lastly, we can note that since the linked list has length $n$, the probability that $X_t$ is greater than $n$ is equal to zero.\n\n\nd.\n Since we have that $t > 0$, we know that the function $f(x) = x^t$ is increasing, so, that means that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor^t \\le f(x)$.

In particular, if we just have that $t = \\sqrt n$. The second algorithm takes time only $O(\\sqrt n)$. This means that tihe first list search algorithm is $O(\\sqrt n)$ as well.\n\n\nh.\n If we don't have distinct key values, then, we may randomly select an element that is further along than we had been before, but not jump to it because it has the same key as what we were currently at.

At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use $O(1)$ space; the operations $\\text{SEARCH}$, $\\text{INSERT}$, and $\\text{DELETE}$ should take $O(1)$ time each; and initializing the data structure should take $O(1)$ time. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Use an additional array, treated somewhat like a stack whose size is the number of keys actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or not.)\n\n\n\n\nWe denote the huge array by $T$ and, taking the hint from the book, we also have a stack implemented by an array $S$. The size of $S$ equals the number of keys actually stored, so that $S$ should be allocated at the dictionary's maximum size. The stack\n\nhas an attribute $S.top$, so that only entries $S[1..S.top]$ are valid.\n\n\nThe idea of this scheme is that entries of $T$ and $S$ validate each other. If key $k$ is\n\nactually stored in $T$, then $T[k]$ contains the index, say $j$, of a valid entry in $S$, and\n\n$S[j]$ contains the value $k$. Let us call this situation, in which $1 \\le T[k] \\le S.top$, $S[T[k]] = k$, and $T[S[j]] = j$, a \nvalidating cycle\n.  \n\n\nAssuming that we also need to store pointers to objects in our direct-address table, we can store them in an array that is parallel to either $T$ or $S$. Since $S$ is smaller than $T$, we'll use an array $S'$, allocated to be the same size as $S$, for these pointers. Thus, if the dictionary contains an object $x$ with key $k$, then there is a validating cycle and $S'[T[k]]$ points to $x$.\n\n\nThe operations on the dictionary work as follows:  \n\n\n\n\nInitialization:\n Simply set $S.top = 0$, so that there are no valid entries in the stack.  \n\n\nSEARCH:\n Given key $k$, we check whether we have a validating cycle, i.e., whether $1 \\le T [k] \\le S.top$ and $S[T[k]] = k$. If so, we return $S'[T[k]]$, and otherwise we return $\\text{NIL}$.  \n\n\nINSERT:\n To insert object $x$ with key $k$, assuming that this object is not already in the dictionary, we increment $S.top$, set $S[S.top] = k$, set $S'[S.top] = x$, and set $T[k] = S.top$.  \n\n\nDELETE:\n To delete object $x$ with key $k$, assuming that this object is in the dictionary, we need to break the validating cycle. The trick is to also ensure that we don't leave a \"hole\" in the stack, and we solve this problem by moving the top entry of the stack into the position that we are vacating-and then fixing up \nthat\n entry's validating cycle. That is, we execute the following sequence of assignments:  \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n    & S[T[k]] = S[S.top]   \\\\\n    & S'[T[k]] = S'[S.top] \\\\\n    & T[S[T[k]]] = T[k]    \\\\\n    & T[k] = 0             \\\\\n    & S.top = S.top - 1\n\\end{align}\n\n\nEach of these operation - initialization, $\\text{SEARCH}$, $\\text{INSERT}$, and $\\text{DELETE}$-takes $O(1)$ time.",

            "text": "We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a  huge  array. At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use $O(1)$ space; the operations $\\text{SEARCH}$, $\\text{INSERT}$, and $\\text{DELETE}$ should take $O(1)$ time each; and initializing the data structure should take $O(1)$ time. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Use an additional array, treated somewhat like a stack whose size is the number of keys actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or not.)   We denote the huge array by $T$ and, taking the hint from the book, we also have a stack implemented by an array $S$. The size of $S$ equals the number of keys actually stored, so that $S$ should be allocated at the dictionary's maximum size. The stack \nhas an attribute $S.top$, so that only entries $S[1..S.top]$ are valid.  The idea of this scheme is that entries of $T$ and $S$ validate each other. If key $k$ is \nactually stored in $T$, then $T[k]$ contains the index, say $j$, of a valid entry in $S$, and \n$S[j]$ contains the value $k$. Let us call this situation, in which $1 \\le T[k] \\le S.top$, $S[T[k]] = k$, and $T[S[j]] = j$, a  validating cycle .    Assuming that we also need to store pointers to objects in our direct-address table, we can store them in an array that is parallel to either $T$ or $S$. Since $S$ is smaller than $T$, we'll use an array $S'$, allocated to be the same size as $S$, for these pointers. Thus, if the dictionary contains an object $x$ with key $k$, then there is a validating cycle and $S'[T[k]]$ points to $x$.  The operations on the dictionary work as follows:     Initialization:  Simply set $S.top = 0$, so that there are no valid entries in the stack.    SEARCH:  Given key $k$, we check whether we have a validating cycle, i.e., whether $1 \\le T [k] \\le S.top$ and $S[T[k]] = k$. If so, we return $S'[T[k]]$, and otherwise we return $\\text{NIL}$.    INSERT:  To insert object $x$ with key $k$, assuming that this object is not already in the dictionary, we increment $S.top$, set $S[S.top] = k$, set $S'[S.top] = x$, and set $T[k] = S.top$.    DELETE:  To delete object $x$ with key $k$, assuming that this object is in the dictionary, we need to break the validating cycle. The trick is to also ensure that we don't leave a \"hole\" in the stack, and we solve this problem by moving the top entry of the stack into the position that we are vacating-and then fixing up  that  entry's validating cycle. That is, we execute the following sequence of assignments:     \\begin{align}\n    & S[T[k]] = S[S.top]   \\\\\n    & S'[T[k]] = S'[S.top] \\\\\n    & T[S[T[k]]] = T[k]    \\\\\n    & T[k] = 0             \\\\\n    & S.top = S.top - 1\n\\end{align}  Each of these operation - initialization, $\\text{SEARCH}$, $\\text{INSERT}$, and $\\text{DELETE}$-takes $O(1)$ time.",

We start by showing that the total number of collisions is minimized by a hash function that maps $u / b$ elements of $U$ to each of the $b$ values in $B$. For a given hash function, let $u_j$ be the number of elements that map to $j \\in B$. We have $u = \\sum_{j \\in B} u_j$. We also have that the number of collisions for a given value of $j \\in B$ is $\\binom{u_j}{2} = u_j(u_j - 1) / 2$.\n\n\nLemma\n\n\nThe total number of collisions is minimized when $u_j = u / b$ for each $j \\in B$.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nIf $u_j \\le u / b$, let us call $j$ \nunderloaded\n, and if $u_j \\ge u / b$, let us call $j$ \noverloaded\n. Consider an unbalanced situation in which $u_j \\ne u / b$ for at least one value $j \\in B$. We can think of converting a balanced situation in which all $u_j$ equal $u / b$ into the unbalanced situation by repeatedly moving an element that maps to an underloaded value to map instead to an overloaded value. (If you think of the values of $B$ as representing buckets, we are repeatedly moving elements from buckets containing at most $u / b$ elements to buckets containing at least $u / b$ elements.)\n\n\nWe now show that each such move increases the number of collisions, so that all the moves together must increase the number of collisions. Suppose that we move an element from an underloaded value $j$ to an overloaded value $k$, and we leave all other elements alone. Because $j$ is underloaded and $k$ is overloaded, $u_j \\le u / b\\le u_k$. Considering just the collisions for values $j$ and $k$, we have $u_j(u_j - 1) / 2 + u_k(u_k - 1) / 2$ collisions before the move and $(u_j - 1)(u_j - 2) / 2 + (u_k + 1)u_k / 2$ collisions afterward. We wish to show that\n\n\n$$u_j(u_j - 1) / 2 + u_k(u_k - 1) / 2 < (u_j - 1)(u_j - 2) / 2 + (u_k + 1)u_k / 2.$$\n\n\nWe have the following sequence of equivalent inequalities:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n                                u_j & < u_k + 1 \\\\\n                               2u_j & < 2u_k + 2 \\\\\n                               -u_k & < u_k - 2u_j + 2 \\\\\n          u_j^2 - u_j + u_k^2 - u_k & < u_j^2 - 3u_j + 2 + u_k^2 + u_k \\\\\n        u_j(u_j - 1) + u_k(u_k - 1) & < (u_j - 1)(u_j - 2) + (u_k + 1)u_k \\\\\nu_j(u_j - 1) / 2 + u_k(u_k - 1) / 2 & < (u_j - 1)(u_j - 2) / 2 + (u_k + 1)u_k / 2.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, each move increases the number of collisions. We conclude that the number of collisions is minimized when $u_j = u / b$ for each $j \\in B$.\n\n\nBy the above lemma, for any hash function, the total number of collisions must  be at least $b(u / b)(u / b - 1) / 2$. The number of pairs of distinct elements is $\\binom{u}{2} = u(u - 1) / 2$. Thus, the number of collisions per pair of distinct elements must be at least\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{b(u / b)(u / b - 1) / 2}{u(u - 1) / 2}\n    & = \\frac{u / b - 1}{u - 1} \\\\\n    & > \\frac{u / b - 1}{u} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{1}{b} - \\frac{1}{u}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the bound  on the probability of a collision for any pair of distinct elements can be no less than $1 / b - 1 / u = 1 / |B| - 1 / |U|$.\n\n\n11.3-6 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nLet $U$ be the set of $n$-tuples of values drawn from $\\mathbb Z_p$, and let $B = \\mathbb Z_p$, where $p$ is prime.

Show that if we can derive string $x$ from string $y$ by permuting its characters, then $x$ and $y$ hash to the same value. Give an example of an application in which this property would be undesirable in a hash function.   First, we observe that we can generate any permutation by a sequence of interchanges of pairs of characters. One can prove this property formally, but informally, consider that both heapsort and quicksort work by interchanging pairs of elements and that they have to be able to produce any permutation of their input array. Thus, it suffices to show that if string $x$ can be derived from string $y$ by interchanging a single pair of characters, then $x$ and $y$ hash to the same value.  Let us denote the $i$th character in $x$ by $x_i$, and similarly for $y$. The interpretation of $x$ in radix $2^p$ is $\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} x_i 2^{ip}$, and so $h(x) = (\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} x_i 2^{ip}) \\mod (2^p - 1)$. Similarly, $h(y) = (\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} y_i 2^{ip}) \\mod (2^p - 1)$.  Suppose that $x$ and $y$ are identical strings of $n$ characters except that the characters in positions $a$ and $b$ are interchanged: $x_a = y_b$ and $y_a = x_b$. Without loss of generality, let $a > b$.

If we show that $(h(x) - h(y)) \\mod (2^p - 1) = 0$, then $h(x) = h(y)$.

As in the proof of Theorem 11.6, if we let $X$ be the random variable denoting the number of probes in an unsuccessful search, then $\\Pr\\{X \\ge i\\} \\le \\alpha^{i - 1}$. Since $n \\le m / 2$, we have $\\alpha \\le 1 / 2$. Letting $i = k + 1$, we have $\\Pr\\{X > k\\} = \\Pr\\{X \\ge k + 1\\} \\le (1 / 2)^{(k + 1) - 1} = 2^{-k}$.\n\n\nb.\n Substituting $k = 2\\lg n$ into the statement of part (a) yields that the probability that the $i$th insertion requires more than $k = 2\\lg n$ probes is at most $2^{-2\\lg n} = (2^{\\lg n})^{-2} = n^{-2} = 1 / n^2$.\n\n\nWe must deal with the possibility that $2\\lg n$ is not an integer, however. Then the event that the $i$th insertion requires more than $2\\lg n$ probes is the same as the event that the $i$th insertion requires more than $\\lfloor 2\\lg n \\rfloor$ probes.

Thus, any constant $c > 6$ works for $n \\ge n_0$.\n\n\nWe handle smaller values of $n$\u2014in particular, $3 \\le n < n_0$\u2014as follows. Since $n$ is constrained to be an integer, there are a finite number of n in the range $3 \\le n < n_0$. We can evaluate the expression $x$ for each such value of $n$ and determine a value of $c$ for which $3 < cx$ for all values of $n$. The final value of $c$ that we use is the larger of\n\n\n\n\n$6$, which works for all $n \\ge n_0$, and \n\n\n$\\max_{3 \\le n \\le n_0}\\{c: 3 < cx\\}$, i.e., the largest value of $c$ that we chose for the range $3 \\le n < n_0$.\n\n\n\n\nThus, we have shown that $Q_{k_0} < 1 / n^3$, as desired.\n\n\nTo see that $P_k < 1 / n^2$ for $k \\ge k_0$, we observe that by part (b), $P_k \\le nQ_k$ for all $k$. Choosing $k = k_0$ gives $P_{k_0} \\le nQ_{k_0} < n \\cdot (1 / n^3) = 1 / n^2$. For $k > k_0$, we will show that we can pick the constant $c$ such that $Q_k < 1 / n^3$ for all $k \\ge k_0$, and thus conclude that $P_k < 1 / n^2$ for all $k \\ge k_0$.\n\n\nTo pick $c$ as required, we let $c$ be large enough that $k_0 > 3 > e$. Then $e / k < 1$ for all $k \\ge k_0$, and so $e^k / k^k$ decreases as $k$ increases. Thus,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nQ_k & <   e^k / k^k \\\\\n    & \\le e^{k_0} / k^{k_0} \\\\\n    & <   1 / n^3 \n\\end{align}\n\n\nfor $k \\ge k_0$.\n\n\ne.\n The expectation of $M$ is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[M] & =   \\sum_{k = 0}^n k \\cdot \\Pr\\{M = k\\} \\\\\n           & =   \\sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} k \\cdot \\Pr\\{M = k\\} + \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n k \\cdot \\Pr\\{M = k\\} \\\\\n           & \\le \\sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} k_0 \\cdot \\Pr\\{M = k\\} + \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n n \\cdot \\Pr\\{M = k\\} \\\\\n           & \\le k_0 \\sum_{k = 0}^{k_0} \\Pr\\{M = k\\} + n \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n \\Pr\\{M = k\\} \\\\\n           & =   k_0 \\cdot \\Pr\\{M \\le k_0\\} + n \\cdot \\Pr\\{M > k_0\\},\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhich is what we needed to show, since $k_0 = c \\lg n / \\lg\\lg n$.\n\n\nTo show that $\\text E[M] = O(\\lg n / \\lg\\lg n)$, note that $\\Pr\\{M \\le k_0\\} \\le 1$ and\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr\\{M > k_0\\} & = \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n \\Pr\\{M = k\\} \\\\\n               & = \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n P_k \\\\\n               & < \\sum_{k = k_0 + 1}^n 1 / n^2 & \\text{(by part (d))} \\\\\n               & < n \\cdot (1 / n^2) \\\\\n               & = 1 / n.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe conclude that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[M] & \\le k_0 \\cdot 1 + n \\cdot (1 / n) \\\\\n           & =   k_0 + 1 \\\\\n           & =   O(\\lg n / \\lg\\lg n).\n\\end{align}",

That is, for any key $k$ and for any probe numbers $i$ and $j$ such that $0 \\le i < j < m$, we have $h'(k, i) \\ne h'(k, j)$.

Since $(j - i)(j + i + 1) / 2 = 0 \\mod m$, we have $(j - i)(j + i + 1) / 2 = rm$ for some integer $r$ or, equivalently, $(j - i)(j + i + 1) = r \\cdot 2m$.

Suppose that the search for key $k$ in a binary search tree ends up in a leaf. Consider three sets: $A$, the keys to the left of the search path; $B$, the keys on the search path; and $C$, the keys to the right of the search path. Professor Bunyan claims that any three keys $a \\in A$, $b \\in B$, and $c \\in C$ must satisfy $a \\le b \\le c$. Give a smallest possible counterexample to the professor's claim.\n\n\n\n\nSearch for $9$ in this tree. Then $A = {7}$, $B = {5, 8, 9}$ and $C = {}$.  So, since $7 > 5$ it breaks professor's claim.\n\n\n12.2-5\n\n\n\n\nShow that if a node in a binary search tree has two children, then its successor has no left child and its predecessor has no right child.\n\n\n\n\nLet $x$ be a node with two children. In an inorder tree walk, the nodes in $x$'s left subtree immediately precede $x$ and the nodes in $x$'s right subtree immediately follow $x$. Thus, $x$'s predecessor is in its left subtree, and its successor is in its right subtree.\n\n\nLet $s$ be $x$'s successor. Then s cannot have a left child, for a left child of $s$ would come between $x$ and $s$ in the inorder walk. (It's after $x$ because it's in $x$'s right subtree, and it's before s because it's in $s$'s left subtree.) If any node were to come between $x$ and $s$ in an inorder walk, then s would not be $x$'s successor, as we had supposed.\n\n\nSymmetrically, $x$'s predecessor has no right child.\n\n\n12.2-6\n\n\n\n\nConsider a binary search tree $T$ whose keys are distinct. Show that if the right subtree of a node $x$ in $T$ is empty and $x$ has a successor $y$, then $y$ is the lowest ancestor of $x$ whose left child is also an ancestor of $x$. (Recall that every node is its own ancestor.)\n\n\n\n\nFirst we establish that $y$ must be an ancestor of $x$. If $y$ weren't an ancestor of $x$, then let $z$ denote the first common ancestor of $x$ and $y$. By the binary-search-tree property, $x < z < y$, so $y$ cannot be the successor of $x$.\n\n\nNext observe that $y.left$ must be an ancestor of $x$ because if it weren't, then $y.right$ would be an ancestor of $x$, implying that $x > y$. Finally, suppose that $y$ is not the lowest ancestor of $x$ whose left child is also an ancestor of $x$. Let $z$ denote this lowest ancestor. Then $z$ must be in the left subtree of $y$, which implies $z < y$, contradicting the fact that $y$ is the successor if $x$.\n\n\n12.2-7\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative method of performing an inorder tree walk of an $n$-node binary search tree finds the minimum element in the tree by calling $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$ and then making $n - 1$ calls to $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$. Prove that this algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nNote that a call to $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$ followed by $n - 1$ calls to $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ performs exactly the same inorder walk of the tree as does the procedure $\\text{INORDER-TREE-WALK}$. $\\text{INORDER-TREE-WALK}$ prints the $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$ first, and by\n\n\ndefinition, the $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ of a node is the next node in the sorted order determined by an inorder tree walk.\n\n\nThis algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time because:\n\n\n\n\nIt requires \u007f$O(n)$ time to do the n procedure calls.\n\n\nIt traverses each of the $n - 1$ tree edges at most twice, which takes $O(n)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nTo see that each edge is traversed at most twice (once going down the tree and once going up), consider the edge between any node $u$ and either of its children, node $v$. By starting at the root, we must traverse $(u, v)$ downward from $u$ to $v$, before traversing it upward from $v$ to $u$. The only time the tree is traversed downward is in code of $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$, and the only time the tree is traversed upward is in code of $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ when we look for the successor of a node that has no right subtree.\n\n\nSuppose that  is $u$'s left child.\n\n\n\n\nBefore printing $u$, we must print all the nodes in its left subtree, which is rooted at $v$, guaranteeing the downward traversal of edge $(u, v)$.\n\n\nAfter all nodes in $u$'s left subtree are printed, $u$ must be printed next. Procedure $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ traverses an upward path to $u$ from the maximum element (which has no right subtree) in the subtree rooted at . This path clearly includes edge $(u, v)$, and since all nodes in $u$'s left subtree are printed, edge $(u, v)$ is never traversed again.\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose that $v$ is $u$'s right child.\n\n\n\n\nAfter $u$ is printed, $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}(u)$ is called. To get to the minimum element in $u$'s right subtree (whose root is $v$), the edge $(u, v)$ must be traversed downward.\n\n\nAfter all values in $u$'s right subtree are printed, $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ is called on the maximum element (again, which has no right subtree) in the subtree rooted at $v$. $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ traverses a path up the tree to an element after $u$, since $u$ was already printed. Edge $(u, v)$ must be traversed upward on this path, and since all nodes in $u$'s right subtree have been printed, edge $(u, v)$ is never traversed again.\n\n\n\n\nHence, no edge is traversed twice in the same direction.\n\n\nTherefore, this algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time.\n\n\n12.2-8\n\n\n\n\nProve that no matter what node we start at in a height-$h$ binary search tree, $k$ successive calls to $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ take $O(k + h)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose $x$ is the starting node and $y$ is the ending node. The distance between $x$ and $y$ is at most $2h$, and all the edges connecting the $k$ nodes are visited twice, therefore it takes $O(k + h)$ time.\n\n\n12.2-9\n\n\n\n\nLet $T$ be a binary search tree whose keys are distinct, let $x$ be a leaf node, and let $y$ be its parent. Show that $y.key$ is either the smallest key in $T$ larger than $x.key$ or the largest key in $T$ smaller than $x.key$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf $x = y.left$, then calling successor on $x$ will result in no iterations of the while loop, and so will return $y$.\n\n\nIf $x = y.right$, the while loop for calling predecessor(see exercise 3) will be run no times, and so $y$ will be returned.",

Note that a call to $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$ followed by $n - 1$ calls to $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ performs exactly the same inorder walk of the tree as does the procedure $\\text{INORDER-TREE-WALK}$. $\\text{INORDER-TREE-WALK}$ prints the $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$ first, and by  definition, the $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ of a node is the next node in the sorted order determined by an inorder tree walk.  This algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time because:   It requires \u007f$O(n)$ time to do the n procedure calls.  It traverses each of the $n - 1$ tree edges at most twice, which takes $O(n)$ time.   To see that each edge is traversed at most twice (once going down the tree and once going up), consider the edge between any node $u$ and either of its children, node $v$. By starting at the root, we must traverse $(u, v)$ downward from $u$ to $v$, before traversing it upward from $v$ to $u$. The only time the tree is traversed downward is in code of $\\text{TREE-MINIMUM}$, and the only time the tree is traversed upward is in code of $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ when we look for the successor of a node that has no right subtree.  Suppose that  is $u$'s left child.   Before printing $u$, we must print all the nodes in its left subtree, which is rooted at $v$, guaranteeing the downward traversal of edge $(u, v)$.  After all nodes in $u$'s left subtree are printed, $u$ must be printed next. Procedure $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ traverses an upward path to $u$ from the maximum element (which has no right subtree) in the subtree rooted at . This path clearly includes edge $(u, v)$, and since all nodes in $u$'s left subtree are printed, edge $(u, v)$ is never traversed again.   Now suppose that $v$ is $u$'s right child.   After $u$ is printed, $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}(u)$ is called. To get to the minimum element in $u$'s right subtree (whose root is $v$), the edge $(u, v)$ must be traversed downward.  After all values in $u$'s right subtree are printed, $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ is called on the maximum element (again, which has no right subtree) in the subtree rooted at $v$. $\\text{TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ traverses a path up the tree to an element after $u$, since $u$ was already printed. Edge $(u, v)$ must be traversed upward on this path, and since all nodes in $u$'s right subtree have been printed, edge $(u, v)$ is never traversed again.   Hence, no edge is traversed twice in the same direction.  Therefore, this algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time.",

Then there exists a path from the root to a node at depth $h$, and the depths of the nodes on this path are $0, 1, \\ldots, h$. Let $P$ be the set of nodes on this path and $Q$ be all other nodes. Then the average depth of a node is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\Big(\\sum_{x \\in P} \\text{depth($x$)} + \\sum_{y \\in Q} \\text{depth($y$)}\\Big)\n    & \\ge \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{x \\in P} \\text{depth($x$)} \\\\\n    & =   \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d = 0}^h d \\\\\n    & =   \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Theta(h^2).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFor the purpose of contradiction, suppose that $h$ is not $O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$, so that $h = \\omega(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$. Then we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Theta(h^2)\n    & = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\omega(n\\lg n) \\\\\n    & = \\omega(\\lg n),\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhich contradicts the assumption that the average depth is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$. Thus, the height is $O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$.\n\n\nHere is an example of an $n$-node binary search tree with average node depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ but height $\\omega(\\lg n)$:\n\n\n\n\nIn this tree, $n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes are a complete binary tree, and the other $\\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes protrude from below as a single chain. This tree has height\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\Theta(\\lg(n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n})) + \\sqrt{n\\lg n}\n    & = \\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\lg n}) \\\\\n    & = \\omega(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nTo compute an upper bound on the average depth of a node, we use $O(\\lg n)$ as an upper bound on the depth p of each of the $n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes in the complete binary tree part and $O(\\lg n + \\sqrt{n\\lg n})$ as an upper bound on the depth of each of the $\\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes in the protruding chain. Thus, the average depth of a node is bounded from above by \n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n}(\\lg n + \\sqrt{n\\lg n}) + (n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n})\\lg n)\n    & = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot O(n\\lg n) \\\\\n    & = O(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nTo bound the average depth of a node from below, observe that the bottommost level of the complete binary tree part has $\\Theta(n - \\sqrt{n - \\lg n})$ nodes, and each of these nodes has depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.

($\\textit{Hint:}$ List the possibilities when $n = 3$.)\n\n\n\n\nFor $n = 3$, there are $5$ binary search trees. However, if we build the trees will a random permutation, the first tree will built twice.\n\n\n12.4-4\n\n\n\n\nShow that the function $f(x) = 2^x$ is convex.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll go one better than showing that the function $2^x$ is convex. Instead, we'll show that the function $c^x$ is convex, for any positive constant $c$. According to the definition of convexity on page 1199 of the text, a function $f(x)$ is convex if for all $x$ and $y$ and for all $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$, we have $f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y) \\le \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda)f(y)$. Thus, we need to show that for all $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$, we have $c^{\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y} \\le \\lambda c^x + (1 - \\lambda)c^y$.\n\n\nWe start by proving the following lemma.\n\n\nLemma\n\n\nFor any real numbers $a$ and $b$ and any positive real number $c$,\n\n\n$$c^a \\ge c^b + (a - b)c^b\\ln c.$$\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nWe first show that for all real $r$, we have $c^r \\ge 1 + r\\ln c$. By equation $\\text{(3.12)}$ from the text, we have $e^x \\ge 1 + x$ for all real $x$. Let $x = r\\ln c$, so that $e^x = e^{r\\ln c} = (e^{\\ln c})^r = c^r$. Then we have $c^r = e^{r\\ln c} \\ge 1 + r\\ln c$.\n\n\nSubstituting $a - b$ for $r$ in the above inequality, we have $c^{a - b} \\ge 1 + (a - b)\\ln c$. Multiplying both sides by $c^b$ gives $c^a \\ge c^b + (a - b)c^b\\ln c$.  (lemma)\n\n\nNow we can show that $c^{\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y} \\le \\lambda c^x + (1 - \\lambda)c^y$ for all $0 \\le \\lambda \\le 1$. For convenience, let $z = \\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y$.\n\n\nIn the inequality given by the lemma, substitute $x$ for $a$ and $z$ for $b$, giving\n\n\n$$c^x \\ge c^z + (x - z)c^z\\ln c.$$\n\n\nAlso substitute $y$ for $a$ and $z$ for $b$, giving\n\n\n$$c^y \\ge c^z + (y - z)c^z\\ln c.$$\n\n\nIf we multiply the first inequality by $\\lambda$ and the second by $1 - \\lambda$ and then add the resulting inequalities, we get\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\lambda c^x + (1 - \\lambda)c^y\n    & \\ge \\lambda(c^z + (x - z)c^z\\ln c) + (1 - \\lambda)(c^z + (y - z)c^z\\ln c) \\\\\n    & =   \\lambda c^z + \\lambda x c^z\\ln c - \\lambda z c^z\\ln c + (1 - \\lambda)c^z + (1 - \\lambda)yc^z\\ln c - (1 - \\lambda)zc^z\\ln c \\\\\n    & =   (\\lambda + (1 - \\lambda))c^z + (\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y)c^z\\ln c - (\\lambda + (1 - \\lambda))zc^z\\ln c \\\\\n    & =   c^z + zc^z\\ln c - zc^z\\ln c \\\\\n    & =   c^z \\\\\n    & =   c^{\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y},\n\\end{align}\n\n\nas we wished to show.\n\n\n12.4-5 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nConsider $\\text{RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT}$ operating on a sequence of $n$ distinct input numbers.

Give an asymptotic upper bound on the height of an $n$-node binary search tree in which the average depth of a node is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.   We will answer the second part first. We shall show that if the average depth of a p node is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$, then the height of the tree is $O(n\\lg n)$. Then we will answer the first part by exhibiting that this bound is tight: there is a binary search tree with p average node depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ and height $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\lg n}) = \\omega(\\lg n)$.  Lemma    If the average depth of p a node in an $n$-node binary search tree is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$, then the height of the tree is $O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$.  Proof  Suppose that an $n$-node binary search tree has average depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ and height $h$. Then there exists a path from the root to a node at depth $h$, and the depths of the nodes on this path are $0, 1, \\ldots, h$. Let $P$ be the set of nodes on this path and $Q$ be all other nodes. Then the average depth of a node is  \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\Big(\\sum_{x \\in P} \\text{depth($x$)} + \\sum_{y \\in Q} \\text{depth($y$)}\\Big)\n    & \\ge \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{x \\in P} \\text{depth($x$)} \\\\\n    & =   \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d = 0}^h d \\\\\n    & =   \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Theta(h^2).\n\\end{align}  For the purpose of contradiction, suppose that $h$ is not $O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$, so that $h = \\omega(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$. Then we have  \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Theta(h^2)\n    & = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\omega(n\\lg n) \\\\\n    & = \\omega(\\lg n),\n\\end{align}  which contradicts the assumption that the average depth is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$. Thus, the height is $O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n})$.  Here is an example of an $n$-node binary search tree with average node depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ but height $\\omega(\\lg n)$:   In this tree, $n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes are a complete binary tree, and the other $\\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes protrude from below as a single chain. This tree has height  \\begin{align}\n\\Theta(\\lg(n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n})) + \\sqrt{n\\lg n}\n    & = \\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\lg n}) \\\\\n    & = \\omega(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}  To compute an upper bound on the average depth of a node, we use $O(\\lg n)$ as an upper bound on the depth p of each of the $n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes in the complete binary tree part and $O(\\lg n + \\sqrt{n\\lg n})$ as an upper bound on the depth of each of the $\\sqrt{n\\lg n}$ nodes in the protruding chain. Thus, the average depth of a node is bounded from above by   \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot O(\\sqrt{n\\lg n}(\\lg n + \\sqrt{n\\lg n}) + (n - \\sqrt{n\\lg n})\\lg n)\n    & = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot O(n\\lg n) \\\\\n    & = O(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}  To bound the average depth of a node from below, observe that the bottommost level of the complete binary tree part has $\\Theta(n - \\sqrt{n - \\lg n})$ nodes, and each of these nodes has depth $\\Theta(\\lg n)$. Thus, the average node depth is at least  \\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Theta((n - \\sqrt{n - \\lg n})\\lg n)\n    & = \\frac{1}{n} \\cdot \\Omega(n\\lg n) \\\\\n    & = \\Omega(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}  Because the average node depth is both $O(\\lg n)$ and $\\Omega(\\lg n)$, it is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.",

Observe that once an element $x$ is chosen as the root of a subtree $T$, all elements that will be inserted after $x$ into $T$ will be compared to $x$. Similarly, observe that once an element $y$ is chosen as the pivot in a subarray $S$, all other elements in $S$ will be compared to $y$. Therefore, the quicksort implementation in which the comparisons are the same as those made when inserting into a binary search tree is simply to consider the pivots in the same order as the order in which the elements are inserted into the tree.",

The idea is simple. Let us define the \nright spine\n as the root and all descendants of the root that are reachable by following only right pointers from the root. A binary search tree that is just a right-going chain has all n nodes in the right spine.\n\n\nAs long as the tree is not just a right spine, repeatedly find some node $y$ on the right spine that has a non-leaf left child $x$ and then perform a right rotation on $y$:\n\n\n\n\n(In the above figure, note that any of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ can be an empty subtree.) Observe that this right rotation adds $x$ to the right spine, and no other nodes leave the right spine. Thus, this right rotation increases the number of nodes in the right spine by $1$. Any binary search tree starts out with at least one node\u2014the root\u2014in the right spine. Moreover, if there are any nodes not on the right spine, then at least one such node has a parent on the right spine. Thus, at most $n - 1$ right rotations are needed to put all nodes in the right spine, so that the tree consists of a single right-going chain.\n\n\nIf we knew the sequence of right rotations that transforms an arbitrary binary search tree $T$ to a single right-going chain $T'$, then we could perform this sequence in reverse\u2014turning each right rotation into its inverse left rotation\u2014to transform $T'$ back into $T$.\n\n\nTherefore, here is how we can transform any binary search tree $T_1$ into any other binary search tree $T_2$. Let $T'$ be the unique right-going chain consisting of the nodes of $T_1$ (which is the same as the nodes of $T_2$). Let $r = \\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\rangle$ be a sequence of right rotations that transforms $T_1$ to $T'$, and let $r' = \\langle r_1', r_2', \\ldots, r_{k'}' \\rangle$ be a sequence of right rotations that transforms $T_2$ to $T'$. We know that there exist sequences $r$ and $r'$ with $k$, $k' \\le n - 1$. For each right rotation $r_i'$, let $l_i'$ be the corresponding inverse left rotation. Then the sequence $\\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k, l_{k'}', l_{k' - 1}', \\ldots, l_2', l_1' \\rangle$ transforms $T_1$ to $T_2$ in at most $2n - 2$ rotations.\n\n\n13.2-5 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nWe say that a binary search tree $T_1$ can be \nright-converted\n to binary search tree $T_2$ if it is possible to obtain $T_2$ from $T_1$ via a series of calls to $\\text{RIGHT-ROTATE}$. Give an example of two trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ such that $T_1$ cannot be right-converted to $T_2$. Then, show that if a tree $T_1$ can be right-converted to $T_2$, it can be right-converted using $O(n^2)$ calls to $\\text{RIGHT-ROTATE}$.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use $O(n)$ calls to rotate the node which is the root in $T_2$ to $T_1$'s root, then use the same operation in the two subtrees. There are $n$ nodes, therefore the upper bound is $O(n^2)$.",

As long as the tree is not just a right spine, repeatedly find some node $y$ on the right spine that has a non-leaf left child $x$ and then perform a right rotation on $y$:   (In the above figure, note that any of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ can be an empty subtree.) Observe that this right rotation adds $x$ to the right spine, and no other nodes leave the right spine. Thus, this right rotation increases the number of nodes in the right spine by $1$. Any binary search tree starts out with at least one node\u2014the root\u2014in the right spine. Moreover, if there are any nodes not on the right spine, then at least one such node has a parent on the right spine. Thus, at most $n - 1$ right rotations are needed to put all nodes in the right spine, so that the tree consists of a single right-going chain.  If we knew the sequence of right rotations that transforms an arbitrary binary search tree $T$ to a single right-going chain $T'$, then we could perform this sequence in reverse\u2014turning each right rotation into its inverse left rotation\u2014to transform $T'$ back into $T$.  Therefore, here is how we can transform any binary search tree $T_1$ into any other binary search tree $T_2$. Let $T'$ be the unique right-going chain consisting of the nodes of $T_1$ (which is the same as the nodes of $T_2$). Let $r = \\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k \\rangle$ be a sequence of right rotations that transforms $T_1$ to $T'$, and let $r' = \\langle r_1', r_2', \\ldots, r_{k'}' \\rangle$ be a sequence of right rotations that transforms $T_2$ to $T'$. We know that there exist sequences $r$ and $r'$ with $k$, $k' \\le n - 1$. For each right rotation $r_i'$, let $l_i'$ be the corresponding inverse left rotation. Then the sequence $\\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_k, l_{k'}', l_{k' - 1}', \\ldots, l_2', l_1' \\rangle$ transforms $T_1$ to $T_2$ in at most $2n - 2$ rotations.",

            "text": "During the course of an algorithm, we sometimes find that we need to maintain past versions of a dynamic set as it is updated. We call such a set \npersistent\n. One way to implement a persistent set is to copy the entire set whenever it is modified, but this approach can slow down a program and also consume much space. Sometimes, we can do much better.\n\n\nConsider a persistent set $S$ with the operations $\\text{INSERT}$, $\\text{DELETE}$, and $\\text{SEARCH}$, which we implement using binary search trees as shown in Figure 13.8(a). We maintain a separate root for every version of the set. In order to insert the key $5$ into the set, we create a new node with key $5$. This node becomes the left child of a new node with key $7$, since we cannot modify the existing node with key $7$. Similarly, the new node with key $7$ becomes the left child of a new node with key $8$ whose right child is the existing node with key $10$. The new node with key $8$ becomes, in turn, the right child of a new root $r'$ with key $4$ whose left child is the existing node with key $3$. We thus copy only part of the tree and share some of the nodes with the original tree, as shown in Figure 13.8(b).\n\n\nAssume that each tree node has the attributes $key$, $left$, and $right$ but no parent. (See also Exercise 13.3-6.)\n\n\na.\n For a general persistent binary search tree, identify the nodes that we need to change to insert a key $k$ or delete a node $y$.\n\n\nb.\n Write a procedure $\\text{PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT}$ that, given a persistent tree $T$ and a key $k$ to insert, returns a new persistent tree $T'$ that is the result of inserting $k$ into $T$.\n\n\nc.\n If the height of the persistent binary search tree $T$ is $h$, what are the time and space requirements of your implementation of $\\text{PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT}$? (The space requirement is proportional to the number of new nodes allocated.)\n\n\nd.\n Suppose that we had included the parent attribute in each node. In this case, $\\text{PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT}$ would need to perform additional copying. Prove that $\\text{PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT}$ would then require $\\Omega(n)$ time and space, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\n\ne.\n Show how to use red-black trees to guarantee that the worst-case running time and space are $O(\\lg n)$ per insertion or deletion.\n\n\n\n\na.\n When inserting key $k$, all nodes on the path from the root to the added node (a new leaf) must change, since the need for a new child pointer propagates up from the new node to all of its ancestors.\n\n\nWhen deleting a node, let $y$ be the node actually removed and $z$ be the node given to the delete procedure.\n\n\n\n\nIf $z$ has at most one child, it will be spliced out, so that all ancestors of $z$ swill be changed. (As with insertion, the need for a new child pointer propagates up from the removed node.)\n\n\nIf $z$ has two children, then its successor $y$ will be spliced out and moved to $z$'s position. Therefore all ancestors of both $z$and $y$ must be changed. Because $z$is an ancestor of $y$, we can just say that all ancestors of $y$ must be changed.\n\n\n\n\nIn either case, $y$'s children (if any) are unchanged, because we have assumed that there is no parent attribute.\n\n\nb.\n We assume that we can call two procedures:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{MAKE-NEW-NODE}(k)$ creates a new node whose $key$ attribute has value $k$ and with $left$ and $right$ attributes $\\text{NIL}$, and it returns a pointer to the new node.\n\n\n$\\text{COPY-NODE}(x)$ creates a new node whose $key$, $left$, and $right$ attributes have the same values as those of node $x$, and it returns a pointer to the new node.\n\n\n\n\nHere are two ways to write $\\text{PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT}$. The first is a version of $\\text{TREE-INSERT}$, modified to create new nodes along the path to where the new node will go, and to not use parent attributes. It returns the root of the new tree.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\nPERSISTENT\n-\nTREE\n-\nINSERT\n(\nT\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n    \nz\n \n=\n \nMAKE\n-\nNEW\n-\nNODE\n(\nk\n)\n\n    \nnew\n-\nroot\n \n=\n \nCOPY\n-\nNODE\n(\nT\n.\nroot\n)\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \nnew\n-\nroot\n\n    \nwhile\n \nx\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n        \ny\n \n=\n \nx\n\n        \nif\n \nz\n.\nkey\n \n<\n \nx\n.\nkey\n\n            \nx\n \n=\n \nCOPY\n-\nNODE\n(\nx\n.\nleft\n)\n\n            \ny\n.\nleft\n \n=\n \nx\n\n        \nelse\n \nx\n \n=\n \nCOPY\n-\nNODE\n(\nx\n.\nright\n)\n\n            \ny\n.\nright\n \n=\n \nx\n\n    \nif\n \ny\n \n==\n \nNIL\n\n        \nnew\n-\nroot\n \n=\n \nz\n\n    \nelse\n \nif\n \nz\n.\nkey\n \n<\n \ny\n.\nkey\n\n        \ny\n.\nleft\n \n=\n \nz\n\n    \nelse\n \ny\n.\nright\n \n=\n \nz\n\n    \nreturn\n \nnew\n-\nroot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second is a rather elegant recursive procedure.

Since the length of the path is at most $h$, it takes $O(h)$ time.\n\n\nSince it allocates a new node (a constant amount of space) for each ancestor of the inserted node, it also needs $O(h)$ space.\n\n\nd.\n If there were parent attributes, then because of the new root, every node of the tree would have to be copied when a new node is inserted. To see why, observe that the children of the root would change to point to the new root, then their children would change to point to them, and so on. Since there are n nodes, this change would cause insertion to create \u007f$\\Omega(n)$ new nodes and to take \u007f$\\Omega(n)$ time.\n\n\ne.\n From parts (a) and (c), we know that insertion into a persistent binary search tree of height $h$, like insertion into an ordinary binary search tree, takes worst-case time $O(h)$. A red-black tree has $h = O(\\lg n)$, so insertion into an ordinary red-black tree takes $O(\\lg n)$ time. We need to show that if the red-black tree is persistent, insertion can still be done in $O(\\lg n)$ time. To do this, we will need to show two things:\n\n\n\n\nHow to still find the parent pointers we need in $O(1)$ time without using a parent attribute. We cannot use a parent attribute because a persistent tree with parent attributes uses $\\Omega(n)$ time for insertion (by part (d)).\n\n\nThat the additional node changes made during red-black tree operations (by rotation and recoloring) don't cause more than $O(\\lg n)$ additional nodes to change.\n\n\n\n\nEach parent pointer needed during insertion can be found in $O(1)$ time without having a parent attribute as follows:\n\n\nTo insert into a red-black tree, we call $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, which in turn calls $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. Make the same changes to $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ as we made to $\\text{TREE-INSERT}$ for persistence. Additionally, as $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ walks down the tree to find the place to insert the new node, have it build a stack of the nodes it traverses and pass this stack to $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ needs parent pointers to walk back up the same path, and at any given time it needs parent pointers only to find the parent and grandparent of the node it is working on. As $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ moves up the stack of parents, it needs only parent pointers that are at known locations a constant distance away in the stack. Thus, the parent information can be found in $O(1)$ time, just as if it were stored in a parent attribute.\n\n\nRotation and recoloring change nodes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ performs at most $2$ rotations, and each rotation changes the child pointers in $3$ nodes (the node around which we rotate, that node's parent, and one of the children of the node around which we rotate). Thus, at most 6 nodes are directly modified by rotation during $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. In a persistent tree, all ancestors of a changed node are copied, so $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$'s rotations take $O(\\lg n)$ time to change nodes due to rotation. (Actually, the changed nodes in this case share a single $O(\\lg n)$-length path of ancestors.)\n\n\n$\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ recolors some of the inserted node's ancestors, which are being changed anyway in persistent insertion, and some children of ancestors (the \"uncles\" referred to in the algorithm description). There are at most $O(\\lg n)$ ancestors, hence at most $O(\\lg n)$ color changes of uncles. Recoloring uncles doesn't cause any additional node changes due to persistence, because the ancestors of the uncles are the same nodes (ancestors of the inserted node) that are being changed anyway due to persistence. Thus, recoloring does not affect the $O(\\lg n)$ running time, even with persistence.\n\n\n\n\nWe could show similarly that deletion in a persistent tree also takes worst-case time $O(h)$.\n\n\n\n\nWe already saw in part (a) that $O(h)$ nodes change.\n\n\nWe could write a persistent $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ procedure that runs in $O(h)$ time, analogous to the changes we made for persistence in insertion. But to do so without using parent pointers we need to walk down the tree to the node to be deleted, to build up a stack of parents as discussed above for insertion. This is a little tricky if the set's keys are not distinct, because in order to find the path to the node to delete\u2014a particular node with a given key\u2014we have to make some changes to how we store things in the tree, so that duplicate keys can be distinguished. The easiest way is to have each key take a second part that is unique, and to use this second part as a tiebreaker when comparing keys.\n\n\n\n\nThen the problem of showing that deletion needs only $O(\\lg n)$ time in a persistent red-black tree is the same as for insertion.\n\n\n\n\nAs for insertion, we can show that the parents needed by $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ can be found in $O(1)$ time (using the same technique as for insertion). \n\n\nAlso, $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ performs at most 3 rotations, which as discussed above for insertion requires $O(\\lg n)$ time to change nodes due to persistence. It also does $O(\\lg n)$ color changes, which (as for insertion) take only $O(\\lg n)$ time to change ancestors due to persistence, because the number of copied nodes is $O(\\lg n)$.",

To implement an AVL tree, we maintain an extra attribute in each node: $x.h$ is the height of node $x$. As for any other binary search tree $T$, we assume that $T.root$ points to the root node.\n\n\na.\n Prove that an AVL tree with $n$ nodes has height $O(\\lg n)$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Prove that an AVL tree of height $h$ has at least $F_h$ nodes, where $F_h$ is the $h$th Fibonacci number.)\n\n\nb.\n To insert into an AVL tree, we first place a node into the appropriate place in binary search tree order. Afterward, the tree might no longer be height balanced. Specifically, the heights of the left and right children of some node might differ by $2$. Describe a procedure $\\text{BALANCE}(x)$, which takes a subtree rooted at $x$ whose left and right children are height balanced and have heights that differ by at most $2$, i.e., $|x.right.h - x.left.h| \\le 2$, and alters the subtree rooted at $x$ to be height balanced. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Use rotations.)\n\n\nc.\n Using part (b), describe a recursive procedure $\\text{AVL-INSERT}(x, z)$ that takes a node $x$ within an AVL tree and a newly created node $z$ (whose key has already been filled in), and adds $z$ to the subtree rooted at $x$, maintaining the property that $x$ is the root of an AVL tree. As in $\\text{TREE-INSERT}$ from Section 12.3, assume that $z.key$ has already been filled in and that $z.left = \\text{NIL}$ and $z.right = \\text{NIL}$; also assume that $z.h = 0$.

Since it is height $h$, it must have the max of it's children's heights is equal to $h - 1$. Since we are trying to get as few notes total as possible, suppose that the other child has as small of a height as is allowed. Because of the restriction of AVL trees, we have that the smaller child must be at least one less than the larger one, so, we have that\n\n\n$$T(h) \\ge T(h - 1) + T(h - 2) + 1,$$\n\n\nwhere the $+1$ is coming from counting the root node. \n\n\nWe can get inequality in the opposite direction by simply taking a tree that achieves the minimum number of number of nodes on height $h - 1$ and on $h - 2$ and join them together under another node. \n\n\nSo, we have that \n\n\n$$T(h) = T(h - 1) + T(h - 2) + 1, \\text{ where } T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1.$$\n\n\nThis is both the same recurrence and initial conditions as the Fibonacci numbers.

As we saw in Section 12.4, however, randomly built binary search trees tend to be balanced. Therefore, one strategy that, on average, builds a balanced tree for a fixed set of items would be to randomly permute the items and then insert them in that order into the tree.\n\n\nWhat if we do not have all the items at once? If we receive the items one at a time, can we still randomly build a binary search tree out of them?\n\n\nWe will examine a data structure that answers this question in the affirmative. A \ntreap\n is a binary search tree with a modified way of ordering the nodes. Figure 13.9 shows an example. As usual, each node $x$ in the tree has a key value $x.key$. In addition, we assign $x.priority$, which is a random number chosen independently for each node. We assume that all priorities are distinct and also that all keys are distinct. The nodes of the treap are ordered so that the keys obey the binary-search-tree property and the priorities obey the min-heap order property:\n\n\n\n\nIf $v$ is a left child of $u$, then $v.key < u.key$.\n\n\nIf $v$ is a right child of $u$, then $v.key > u.key$.\n\n\nIf $v$ is a child of $u$, then $v.priority > u.priority$.\n\n\n\n\n(This combination of properties is why the tree is called a \"treap\": it has features of both a binary search tree and a heap.)\n\n\nIt helps to think of treaps in the following way. Suppose that we insert nodes $x_1, x_2, \\ldots,x_n$, with associated keys, into a treap. Then the resulting treap is the tree that would have been formed if the nodes had been inserted into a normal binary search tree in the order given by their (randomly chosen) priorities, i.e., $x_i.priority < x_j.priority$ means that we had inserted $x_i$ before $x_j$.\n\n\na.\n Show that given a set of nodes $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$, with associated keys and priorities, all distinct, the treap associated with these nodes is unique.\n\n\nb.\n Show that the expected height of a treap is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$, and hence the expected time to search for a value in the treap is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nLet us see how to insert a new node into an existing treap. The first thing we do is assign to the new node a random priority. Then we call the insertion algorithm, which we call $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$, whose operation is illustrated in Figure 13.10.\n\n\nc.\n Explain how $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ works. Explain the idea in English and give pseudocode. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Execute the usual binary-search-tree insertion procedure and then perform rotations to restore the min-heap order property.)\n\n\nd.\n Show that the expected running time of $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.\n\n\n$\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ performs a search and then a sequence of rotations. Although these two operations have the same expected running time, they have different costs in practice. A search reads information from the treap without modifying it. In contrast, a rotation changes parent and child pointers within the treap. On most computers, read operations are much faster than write operations. Thus we would like $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ to perform few rotations. We will show that the expected number of rotations performed is bounded by a constant.\n\n\nIn order to do so, we will need some definitions, which Figure 13.11 depicts. The \nleft spine\n of a binary search tree $T$ is the simple path from the root to the node with the smallest key. In other words, the left spine is the simple path from the root that consists of only left edges. Symmetrically, the \nright spine\n of $T$ is the simple path from the root consisting of only right edges. The \nlength\n of a spine is the number of nodes it contains.\n\n\ne.\n Consider the treap $T$ immediately after $\\text{TREAP-INSERT}$ has inserted node $x$. Let $C$ be the length of the right spine of the left subtree of $x$. Let $D$ be the length of the left spine of the right subtree of $x$. Prove that the total number of rotations that were performed during the insertion of $x$ is equal to $C + D$.\n\n\nWe will now calculate the expected values of $C$ and $D$. Without loss of generality, we assume that the keys are $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ since we are comparing them only to one another.\n\n\nFor nodes $x$ and $y$ in treap $T$, where $y \\ne x$, let $k = x.key$ and $i = y.key$. We define indicator random variables\n\n\n$$X_{ik} = \\text{I\\{$y$ is in the right spine of the left subtree of $x$\\}}.$$\n\n\nf.\n Show that $X_{ik} = 1$ if and only if $y.priority > x.priority$, $y.key < x.key$, and, for every $z$ such that $y.key < z.key < x.key$, we have $y.priority < z.priority$.\n\n\ng.\n Show that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr\\{X_{ik} = 1\\}\n    & = \\frac{(k - i - 1)!}{(k - i + 1)!} \\\\\n    & = \\frac{1}{(k - i + 1)(k - i)}. \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n\nh.\n Show that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[C] & = \\sum_{j = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{j(j + 1)} \\\\\n           & = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\ni.\n Use a symmetry argument to show that\n\n\n$$\\text E[D] = 1 - \\frac{1}{n - k + 1}.$$\n\n\nj.\n Conclude that the expected number of rotations performed when inserting a node into a treap is less than $2$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n The root is the node with smallest priority, the root divides the sets into two subsets based on the key. In each subset, the node with smallest priority is selected as the root, thus we can uniquely determine a treap with a specific input.\n\n\nb.\n For the priority of all nodes, each permutation corresponds to exactly one treap, that is, all nodes forms a BST in priority, since the priority of all nodes is spontaneous, treap is, essentially, randomly built binary search tress. Therefore, the expected height of a treap is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nc.\n First insert a node as usual using the binary-search-tree insertion procedure. Then perform left and right rotations until the parent of the inserted node no longer has larger priority.\n\n\nd.\n Rotation is $\\Theta(1)$, at most $h$ rotations, therefore the expected running time is $\\Theta(\\lg n)$.\n\n\ne.\n Left rotation increase $C$ by $1$, right rotation increase $D$ by $1$.\n\n\nf.\n The first two are obvious.\n\n\nThe min-heap property will not hold if $y.priority > z.priority$.\n\n\ng.\n \n\n\n$$\\Pr\\{X_{ik} = 1\\} = \\frac{(k - i - 1)!}{(k - i + 1)!} = \\frac{1}{(k - i + 1)(k - i)}.$$\n\n\nh.\n \n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[C] & = \\sum_{j = 1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{(k - i + 1)(k - i)} \\\\\n           & = \\sum_{j = 1}^{k - 1} (\\frac{1}{k - i} - \\frac{1}{k - i + 1}) \\\\\n           & = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\ni.\n \n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text E[D] & = \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - k} \\frac{1}{(k - i + 1)(k - i)} \\\\\n           & = 1 - \\frac{1}{n - k + 1}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nj.\n By part (e), the number of rotations is $C + D$.

How about maintaining the depths of nodes?\n\n\n\n\nYes, we can maintain black-heights as attributes in the nodes of a red-black tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of the red-black tree operations. We appeal to Theorem 14.1, because the black-height of a node can be computed from the information at the node and its two children. Actually, the black-height can be computed from just one child's information: the black-height of a node is the black-height of a red child, or the black height of a black child plus one. The second child does not need to be checked because of property 5 of red-black trees.\n\n\nWithin the $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ procedures are color changes, each of which potentially cause $O(\\lg n)$ black-height changes. Let us show that the color changes of the fixup procedures cause only local black-height changes and thus are constant-time operations. Assume that the black-height of each node $x$ is kept in the attribute $x.bh$.\n\n\nFor $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$, there are 3 cases to examine.\n\n\nCase 1:\n $z$'s uncle is red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore color changes, suppose that all subtrees $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, $\\epsilon$ have the same black-height $k$ with a black root, so that nodes $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ have blackheights of $k + 1$.\n\n\nAfter color changes, the only node whose black-height changed is node $C$. To fix that, add $z.p.p.bh = z.p.p.bh + 1$ after line 7 in $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. \n\n\nSince the number of black nodes between $z.p.p$ and $z$ remains the same, nodes above $z.p.p$ are not affected by the color change.\n\n\n\n\nCase 2:\n $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a right child.\n\n\nCase 3:\n $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a left child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith subtrees $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, $\\epsilon$ of black-height $k$, we see that even with color changes and rotations, the black-heights of nodes $A$, $B$, and $C$ remain the same $(k + 1)$.\n\n\n\n\nThus, $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ maintains its original $O(\\lg n)$ time.\n\nFor $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$, there are 4 cases to examine.\n\n\nCase 1:\n $x$'s sibling $w$ is red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though case 1 changes colors of nodes and does a rotation, blackheights are not changed.\n\n\nCase 1 changes the structure of the tree, but waits for cases 2, 3, and 4 to deal with the \"extra black\" on $x$.\n\n\n\n\nCase 2:\n $x$'s sibling $w$ is black, and both of $w$'s children are black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$w$ is colored red, and $x$'s \"extra\" black is moved up to $x.p$.\n\n\nNow we can add $x.p.bh = x.bh$ after line 10 in $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$.\n\n\nThis is a constant-time update. Then, keep looping to deal with the extra black on $x.p$.\n\n\n\n\nCase 3:\n $x$'s sibling w is black, $w$'s left child is red, and $w$'s right child is black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the color changes and rotation of this case, the black-heights don't change.\n\n\nCase 3 just sets up the structure of the tree, so it can fall correctly into case 4.\n\n\n\n\nCase 4:\n $x$'s sibling $w$ is black, and $w$'s right child is red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNodes $A$, $C$, and $E$ keep the same subtrees, so their black-heights don't change.\n\n\nAdd these two constant-time assignments in $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ after line 20:\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  x.p.bh & = x.bh + 1 \\\\\nx.p.p.bh & = x.p.bh + 1\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extra black is taken care of. Loop terminates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ maintains its original $O(\\lg n)$ time.\n\n\nTherefore, we conclude that black-heights of nodes can be maintained as attributes in red-black trees without affecting the asymptotic performance of red-black tree operations.\n\n\nFor the second part of the question, no, we cannot maintain node depths without affecting the asymptotic performance of red-black tree operations. The depth of a node depends on the depth of its parent. When the depth of a node changes, the depths of all nodes below it in the tree must be updated.

            "text": "Can we maintain the black-heights of nodes in a red-black tree as attributes in the nodes of the tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of any of the redblack tree operations? Show how, or argue why not. How about maintaining the depths of nodes?   Yes, we can maintain black-heights as attributes in the nodes of a red-black tree without affecting the asymptotic performance of the red-black tree operations. We appeal to Theorem 14.1, because the black-height of a node can be computed from the information at the node and its two children. Actually, the black-height can be computed from just one child's information: the black-height of a node is the black-height of a red child, or the black height of a black child plus one. The second child does not need to be checked because of property 5 of red-black trees.  Within the $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ procedures are color changes, each of which potentially cause $O(\\lg n)$ black-height changes. Let us show that the color changes of the fixup procedures cause only local black-height changes and thus are constant-time operations. Assume that the black-height of each node $x$ is kept in the attribute $x.bh$.  For $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$, there are 3 cases to examine.  Case 1:  $z$'s uncle is red.    Before color changes, suppose that all subtrees $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, $\\epsilon$ have the same black-height $k$ with a black root, so that nodes $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ have blackheights of $k + 1$.  After color changes, the only node whose black-height changed is node $C$. To fix that, add $z.p.p.bh = z.p.p.bh + 1$ after line 7 in $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$.   Since the number of black nodes between $z.p.p$ and $z$ remains the same, nodes above $z.p.p$ are not affected by the color change.   Case 2:  $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a right child.  Case 3:  $z$'s uncle $y$ is black, and $z$ is a left child.    With subtrees $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\delta$, $\\epsilon$ of black-height $k$, we see that even with color changes and rotations, the black-heights of nodes $A$, $B$, and $C$ remain the same $(k + 1)$.   Thus, $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ maintains its original $O(\\lg n)$ time. \nFor $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$, there are 4 cases to examine.  Case 1:  $x$'s sibling $w$ is red.    Even though case 1 changes colors of nodes and does a rotation, blackheights are not changed.  Case 1 changes the structure of the tree, but waits for cases 2, 3, and 4 to deal with the \"extra black\" on $x$.   Case 2:  $x$'s sibling $w$ is black, and both of $w$'s children are black.    $w$ is colored red, and $x$'s \"extra\" black is moved up to $x.p$.  Now we can add $x.p.bh = x.bh$ after line 10 in $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$.  This is a constant-time update. Then, keep looping to deal with the extra black on $x.p$.   Case 3:  $x$'s sibling w is black, $w$'s left child is red, and $w$'s right child is black.    Regardless of the color changes and rotation of this case, the black-heights don't change.  Case 3 just sets up the structure of the tree, so it can fall correctly into case 4.   Case 4:  $x$'s sibling $w$ is black, and $w$'s right child is red.    Nodes $A$, $C$, and $E$ keep the same subtrees, so their black-heights don't change.  Add these two constant-time assignments in $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ after line 20:   \n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  x.p.bh & = x.bh + 1 \\\\\nx.p.p.bh & = x.p.bh + 1\n\\end{align}\n$$    The extra black is taken care of. Loop terminates.    Thus, $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ maintains its original $O(\\lg n)$ time.  Therefore, we conclude that black-heights of nodes can be maintained as attributes in red-black trees without affecting the asymptotic performance of red-black tree operations.

The depth of a node depends on the depth of its parent. When the depth of a node changes, the depths of all nodes below it in the tree must be updated.

If node $x$ overlaps $i$, and some node in the right subtree overlaps $i$, but no node in the left subtree overlaps $i$, then because the keys are low endpoints, this order of checking (first  $x$, then one child) will return the overlapping interval with the minimum low endpoint. On the other hand, if there is an interval that overlaps $i$ in the left subtree of $x$, then checking $x$ before the left subtree might cause the procedure to return an interval whose low endpoint is not the minimum of those that overlap $i$. Therefore, if there is a possibility that the left subtree might contain an interval that overlaps $i$, we need to check the left subtree first. If there is no overlap in the left subtree but node $x$ overlaps $i$, then we return $x$. We check the right subtree under the same conditions as in $\\text{INTERVAL-SEARCH}$: the left subtree cannot contain an interval that overlaps $i$, and node $x$ does not overlap $i$, either.\n\n\nBecause we might search the left subtree first, it is easier to write the pseudocode to use a recursive procedure $\\text{MIN-INTERVAL-SEARCH-FROM}(T, x, i)$, which returns the node overlapping $i$ with the minimum low endpoint in the subtree rooted at $x$, or $T.nil$ if there is no such node.\n\n\n1\n2\nMIN\n-\nINTERVAL\n-\nSEARCH\n(\nT\n,\n \ni\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMIN\n-\nINTERVAL\n-\nSEARCH\n-\nFROM\n(\nT\n,\n \nT\n.\nroot\n,\n \ni\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nMIN\n-\nINTERVAL\n-\nSEARCH\n-\nFROM\n(\nT\n,\n \nx\n,\n \ni\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nx\n.\nleft\n \n!=\n \nT\n.\nnil\n \nand\n \nx\n.\nleft\n.\nmax\n \n\u2265\n \ni\n.\nlow\n\n        \ny\n \n=\n \nMIN\n-\nINTERVAL\n-\nSEARCH\n-\nFROM\n(\nT\n,\n \nx\n.\nleft\n,\n \ni\n)\n\n        \nif\n \ny\n \n!=\n \nT\n.\nnil\n\n            \nreturn\n \ny\n\n        \nelse\n \nif\n \ni\n \noverlaps\n \nx\n.\nint\n\n            \nreturn\n \nx\n\n        \nelse\n \nreturn\n \nT\n.\nnil\n\n    \nelse\n \nif\n \ni\n \noverlaps\n \nx\n.\nint\n\n        \nreturn\n \nx\n\n    \nelse\n \nreturn\n \nMIN\n-\nINTERVAL\n-\nSEARCH\n-\nFROM\n(\nT\n,\n \nx\n.\nright\n,\n \ni\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe call $\\text{MIN-INTERVAL-SEARCH}(T, i)$ takes $O\\lg n)$ time, since each recursive call of $\\text{MIN-INTERVAL-SEARCH-FROM}$ goes one node lower in the tree, and the height of the tree is $O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\n14.3-4\n\n\n\n\nGiven an interval tree $T$ and an interval $i$, describe how to list all intervals in $T$ that overlap $i$ in $O(\\min(n, k \\lg n))$ time, where $k$ is the number of intervals in the output list.

For example, if $Q = \\{1, 5, 9, 15, 18, 22 \\}$, then $\\text{MIN-GAP}(Q)$ returns $18 - 15 = 3$, since $15$ and $18$ are the two closest numbers in $Q$.

It has the magnitude of the difference of the two closest numbers in the subtree rooted at $x$. If $x$ is a leaf (its children are all $T.nil$), let $x.min\\text-gap = \\infty$. \n\n\n$x.min\\text-val$ contains the minimum value ($key$) in the subtree rooted at $x$. \n\n\n$x.max\\text-val$ contains the maximum value ($key$) in the subtree rooted at $x$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining the information:\n\n    The three attributes added to the tree can each be computed from information in the node and its children. Hence by Theorem 14.1, they can be maintained during insertion and deletion without affecting the $O(\\lg n)$ running time:\n\n\n$$\nx.min\\text-val =\n\\begin{cases}\nx.left.min\\text-val & \\text{if there is a left subtree}, \\\\\n              x.key & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n$$\nx.max\\text-val =\n\\begin{cases}\nx.right.max\\text-val & \\text{if there is a right subtree}, \\\\\n               x.key & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n$$\nx.min\\text-gap = \\min\n\\begin{cases}\n         x.left.min\\text-gap & \\text{($\\infty$ if no left subtree)}, \\\\\n        x.right.min\\text-gap & \\text{($\\infty$ if no right subtree)}, \\\\\n x.key - x.left.max\\text-val & \\text{($\\infty$ if no left subtree)}, \\\\\nx.right.min\\text-val - x.key & \\text{($\\infty$ if no right subtree)}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nIn fact, the reason for defining the $min\\text-val$ and $min\\text-val$ attributes is to make it possible to compute $min\\text-gap$ from information at the node and its children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew operation:\n\n    $\\text{MIN-GAP}$ simply returns the $min\\text-gap$ stored at the tree root. Thus, its running time is $O(1)$.\n\n    Note that in addition (not asked for in the exercise), it is possible to find the two closest numbers in $O(\\lg n)$ time. Starting from the root, look for where the minimum gap (the one stored at the root) came from. At each node $x$, simulate the computation of $x.min\\text-gap$ to figure out where $x.min\\text-gap$ came from. If it came from a subtree's $min\\text-gap$ attribute, continue the search in that subtree. If it came from a computation with $x$'s key, then $x$ and that other number are the closest numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3-7 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nVLSI databases commonly represent an integrated circuit as a list of rectangles.

Underlying data structure: \n    A red-black tree in which the numbers in the set are stored simply as the keys of the nodes. \n    $\\text{SEARCH}$ is then just the ordinary $\\text{TREE-SEARCH}$ for binary search trees, which runs in $O(\\lg n)$ time on red-black trees.    Additional information: \n    The red-black tree is augmented by the following attributes in each node $x$:     $x.min\\text-gap$ contains the minimum gap in the subtree rooted at $x$. It has the magnitude of the difference of the two closest numbers in the subtree rooted at $x$.

Maintaining the information: \n    The three attributes added to the tree can each be computed from information in the node and its children.

New operation: \n    $\\text{MIN-GAP}$ simply returns the $min\\text-gap$ stored at the tree root. Thus, its running time is $O(1)$. \n    Note that in addition (not asked for in the exercise), it is possible to find the two closest numbers in $O(\\lg n)$ time. Starting from the root, look for where the minimum gap (the one stored at the root) came from. At each node $x$, simulate the computation of $x.min\\text-gap$ to figure out where $x.min\\text-gap$ came from. If it came from a subtree's $min\\text-gap$ attribute, continue the search in that subtree. If it came from a computation with $x$'s key, then $x$ and that other number are the closest numbers.",

($\\textit{Hint:}$ Keep a red-black tree of all the endpoints. Associate a value of $+1$ with each left endpoint, and associate a value of $-1$ with each right endpoint. Augment each node of the tree with some extra information to maintain the point of maximum overlap.)\n\n\n\n\na.\n Assume for the purpose of contradiction that there is no point of maximum overlap in an endpoint of a segment. The maximum overlap point $p$ is in the interior of $m$ segments. Actually, $p$ is in the interior of the intersection of those $m$ segments. Now look at one of the endpoints $p'$ of the intersection of the $m$ segments. Point $p'$ has the same overlap as $p$ because it is in the same intersection of $m$ segments, and so $p'$ is also a point of maximum overlap. Moreover, $p'$ is in the endpoint of a segment (otherwise the intersection would not end there), which contradicts our assumption that there is no point of maximum overlap in an endpoint of a segment. Thus, there is always a point of maximum overlap which is an endpoint of one of the segments.\n\n\nb.\n Keep a balanced binary search tree of the endpoints. That is, to insert an interval, we insert its endpoints separately. With each left endpoint $e$, associate a value $p(e) = +1$ (increasing the overlap by $1$). With each right endpoint $e$ associate a value $p(e) = -1$ (decreasing the overlap by $1$). When multiple endpoints have the same value, insert all the left endpoints with that value before inserting any of the right endpoints with that value.\n\n\nHere's some intuition. Let $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_n$ be the sorted sequence of endpoints corresponding to our intervals. Let $s(i, j)$ denote the sum $p(e_i) + p(e_{i + 1}) + \\cdots + p(e_j)$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$. We wish to find an $i$ maximizing $s(1, i)$.\n\n\nFor each node $x$ in the tree, let $l(x)$ and $r(x)$ be the indices in the sorted order of the leftmost and rightmost endpoints, respectively, in the subtree rooted at $x$. Then the subtree rooted at $x$ contains the endpoints $e_{l(x)}, e_{l(x) + 1}, \\ldots, e_{r(x)}$.\n\n\nEach node $x$ stores three new attributes. We store $x.v = s(l(x), r(x))$, the sum of the values of all nodes in the subtree rooted at $x$. We also store $x.m$, the maximum value obtained by the expression $s(l(x), i)$ for any $i$ in ${l(x), l(x) + 1, \\ldots, r(x)}$. Finally, we store $x.o$ as the value of $i$ for which $x.m$ achieves its maximum. For the sentinel, we define $T.nil.v = T.nil.m = 0$.\n\n\nWe can compute these attributes in a bottom-up fashion to satisfy the requirements of Theorem 14.1:\n\n\n$$x.v = x.left.v + p(x) + x.right.v,$$\n\n\n$$\nx.m = \\max\n\\begin{cases}\n                   x.left.m & \\text{(max is in $x$'s left subtree)}, \\\\\n            x.left.v + p(x) & \\text{(max is at $x$)}, \\\\\nx.left.v + p(x) + x.right.m & \\text{(max is in $x$'s right subtree)}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nComputing $x.v$ is straightforward. Computing $x.m$ bears further explanation. Recall that it is the maximum value of the sum of the $p$ values for the nodes in the subtree rooted at $x$, starting at the node for $e_{l(x)}$, which is the leftmost endpoint in $x$'s subtree, and ending at any node for $e_i$ in $x$'s subtree. The endpoint $e_i$ that maximizes this sum\u2014let's call it $e_{i^*}$\u2014corresponds to either a node in $x$'s left subtree, $x$ itself, or a node in $x$'s right subtree. If $e_{i^*}$  corresponds to a node in $x$'s left subtree, then $x.left.m$ represents a sum starting at the node for $e_{l(x)}$ and ending at a node in $x$'s left subtree, and hence $x.m = x.left.m$. If $e_i$ corresponds to $x$ itself, then $x.m$ represents the sum of all $p$ values in $x$'s left subtree, plus $p(x)$, so that $x.m = x.left.v + p(x)$. Finally, if $e_{i^*}$ corresponds to a node in $x$'s right subtree, then $x.m$ represents the sum of all $p$ values in $x$'s left subtree, plus $p(x)$, plus the sum of some subset of $p$ values in $x$'s right subtree. Moreover, the values taken from $x$'s right subtree must start from the leftmost endpoint stored in the right subtree. To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the sum from the right subtree, and that value is precisely $x.right.m$. Hence, in this case, $x.m = x.left.v + p(x) + x.right.m$.\n\n\nOnce we understand how to compute $x.m$, it is straightforward to compute $x.o$ from the information in $x$ and its two children. Thus, we can implement the operations as follows:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{INTERVAL-INSERT}$: insert two nodes, one for each endpoint of the interval.\n\n\n$\\text{FIND-POM}$: return the interval whose endpoint is represented by $T.root.o$.\n\n\n\n\n(Note that because we are building a binary search tree of all the endpoints and then determining $T.root.o$, we have no need to delete any nodes from the tree.)\n\n\nBecause of how we have defined the new attributes, Theorem 14.1 says that each operation runs in $O(\\lg n)$ time. In fact, $\\text{FIND-POM}$ takes only $O(1)$ time.",

Beginning with a designated first person, we proceed around the circle, removing every $m$th person. After each person is removed, counting continues around the circle that remains. This process continues until we have removed all $n$ people. The order in which the people are removed from the circle defines the \n$(n, m)$-Josephus permutation\n of the integers $1, 2, \\ldots, n$.

At the beginning, we initialize the list to contain the keys $1, 2, \\ldots, n$ in that order. This initialization takes $O(n)$ time, since there is only a constant amount of work per element (i.e., setting its $key$ and its $next$ attributes). We make the list circular by letting the $next$ attribute of the last element point to the first element.\n\n\nWe then start scanning the list from the beginning. We output and then delete every $m$th element, until the list becomes empty. The output sequence is the $(n, m)$-Josephus permutation. This process takes $O(m)$ time per element, for a total time of $O(mn)$. Since m is a constant, we get $O(mn) = O(n)$ time, as required.\n\n\nb.\n We can use an order-statistic tree, straight out of Section 14.1. Why? Suppose that we are at a particular spot in the permutation, and let's say that it's the $j$th largest remaining person. Suppose that there are $k \\le n$ people remaining. Then we will remove person $j$, decrement $k$ to reflect having removed this person, and then go on to the $(j + m - 1)$ largest remaining person (subtract $1$ because we have just removed the $j$th largest).

Justify your answer.\n\n\n\n\nRunning $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is asymptotically more efficient than enumerating all the ways of parenthesizing the product and computing the number of multiplications for each.\n\n\nConsider the treatment of subproblems by the two approaches.\n\n\n\n\nFor each possible place to split the matrix chain, the enumeration approach \u00dends all ways to parenthesize the left half, finds all ways to parenthesize the right half, and looks at all possible combinations of the left half with the right half. The amount of work to look at each combination of left- and right-half subproblem results is thus the product of the number of ways to do the left half and the number of ways to do the right half.\n\n\nFor each possible place to split the matrix chain, $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ finds the best way to parenthesize the left half, finds the best way to parenthesize the right half, and combines just those two results. Thus the amount of work to combine the left- and right-half subproblem results is $O(1)$.\n\n\n\n\nSection 15.2 argued that the running time for enumeration is $\\Omega(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$. We will show that the running time for $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is $O(n3^{n - 1})$.\n\n\nTo get an upper bound on the running time of $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$, we'll use the same approach used in Section 15.2 to get a lower bound: Derive a recurrence of the form $T(n) \\le \\ldots$ and solve it by substitution. For the lower-bound recurrence, the book assumed that the execution of lines 1\u20132 and 6\u20137 each take at least unit time. For the upper-bound recurrence, we'll assume those pairs of lines each take at most constant time $c$. Thus, we have the recurrence\n\n\n$$\nT(n) \\le\n\\begin{cases}\n                                             c & \\text{if $n = 1$}, \\\\\nc + \\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} (T(k) + T(n - k) + c) & \\text{if $n \\ge 2$}. \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThis is just like the book's $\\ge$ recurrence except that it has $c$ instead of $1$, and so we can be rewrite it as\n\n\n$$T(n) \\le 2 \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} T(i) + cn.$$\n\n\nWe shall prove that $T(n) = O(n3^{n - 1})$ using the substitution method. (Note: Any upper bound on $T(n)$ that is $o(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$ will suffice. You might prefer to prove one that is easier to think up, such as $T(n) = O(3.5^n)$.) Specifically, we shall show that $T(n) \\le cn3^{n - 1}$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The basis is easy, since $T(1) \\le c = c \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3^{1 - 1}$ .\n\n\nInductively, for $n \\ge 2$ we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & \\le 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} T(i) + cn \\\\\n     & \\le 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} ci 3^{i - 1} + cn \\\\\n     & \\le c \\cdot \\bigg(2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}i 3^{i - 1} + n\\bigg) \\\\\n     & =   c \\cdot \\bigg(2\\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{n 3^{n - 1}}{3 - 1} + \\frac{1 - 3^n}{(3 - 1)^2}\\bigg) + n\\bigg) & \\text{(see below)} \\\\\n     & =   cn 3^{n - 1} + c\\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{1 - 3^n}{2} + n\\bigg) \\\\\n     & =   cn 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{c}{2}(2n + 1 - 3^n) \\\\\n     & \\le cn 3^{n - 1} & \\text{for all $c > 0, n \\ge 1$}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nRunning $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ takes $O(n3^{n - 1})$ time, and enumerating all parenthesizations takes $(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$ time, and so $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is more efficient than enumeration.\n\n\nNote: The above substitution uses the fact that\n\n\n$$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} ix^{i - 1} = \\frac{nx^{n - 1}}{x - 1} + \\frac{1 - x^n}{(x - 1)^2}.$$\n\n\nThis equation can be derived from equation $\\text{(A.5)}$ by taking the derivative.

Explain why memoization fails to speed up a good divide-and-conquer algorithm such as $\\text{MERGE-SORT}$.\n\n\n\n\nDraw a recursion tree. The $\\text{MERGE-SORT}$ procedure performs at most a single call to any pair of indices of the array that is being sorted. In other words, the subproblems do not overlap and therefore memoization will not improve the running time.\n\n\n15.3-3\n\n\n\n\nConsider a variant of the matrix-chain multiplication problem in which the goal is to parenthesize the sequence of matrices so as to maximize, rather than minimize, the number of scalar multiplications. Does this problem exhibit optimal substructure?\n\n\n\n\nYes, this problem also exhibits optimal substructure. If we know that we need the subproduct $(A_l \\cdot A_r)$, then we should still find the most expensive way to compute it \u2014 otherwise, we could do better by substituting in the most expensive way.\n\n\n15.3-4\n\n\n\n\nAs stated, in dynamic programming we first solve the subproblems and then choose which of them to use in an optimal solution to the problem. Professor Capulet claims that we do not always need to solve all the subproblems in order to find an optimal solution. She suggests that we can find an optimal solution to the matrix-chain multiplication problem by always choosing the matrix $A_k$ at which to split the subproduct $A_i A_{i + 1} \\cdots A_j$ (by selecting $k$ to minimize the quantity $p_{i - 1} p_k p_j$) \nbefore\n solving the subproblems. Find an instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem for which this greedy approach yields a suboptimal solution.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we are given matrices $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, and $A_4$ with dimensions such that\n\n\n$$p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 = 1000, 100, 20, 10, 1000.$$\n\n\nThen $p_0 p_k p_4$ is minimized when $k = 3$, so we need to solve the subproblem of multiplying $A_1 A_2 A_3$, and also $A_4$ which is solved automatically. By her algorithm, this is solved by splitting at $k = 2$. Thus, the full parenthesization is $(((A_1A_2)A_3)A_4)$.\nThis requires \n\n\n$$1000 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 20 + 1000 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 = 12200000$$\n\n\nscalar multiplications.\n\n\nOn the other hand, suppose we had fully parenthesized the matrices to multiply as $((A_1(A_2A_3))A_4)$. Then we would only require \n\n\n$$100 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 = 11020000$$\n\n\nscalar multiplications, which is fewer than Professor Capulet's method.\n\n\nTherefore her greedy approach yields a suboptimal solution.\n\n\n15.3-5\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that in the rod-cutting problem of Section 15.1, we also had limit $l_i$ on the number of pieces of length $i$ that we are allowed to produce, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Show that the optimal-substructure property described in Section 15.1 no longer holds.\n\n\n\n\nWe say that a problem exhibits the optimal substructure property when optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems, \nwhich we may solve independently\n (i.e., they do not share resources). When we impose a limit $l_i$ on the number of pieces of size $i$ that we are permitted to produce, the subproblems can no longer be solved \nindependently\n. For example, consider a rod of length $4$ with the following prices and limits:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\text{length $i$}  &  1 &  2 &  3 &  4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{price $p_i$} & 15 & 20 & 33 & 36 \\\\\n\\text{limit $l_i$} &  2 &  1 &  1 &  1 \n\\end{array}\n\n\nThis instance has only three solutions that do not violate the limits: length $4$ with price $36$; lengths $1$ and $3$ with price $48$; and lengths $1$, $1$, and $2$ with price $50$. The optimal solution, therefore is to cut into lengths $1$, $1$, and $2$. When we look at the subproblem for length $2$, it has two solutions that do not violate the limits: length $2$ with price $20$, and lengths $1$ and $1$ with price $30$. The optimal solution for length $2$, therefore, is to cut into lengths $1$ and $1$. But we cannot use this optimal solution for the subproblem in the optimal solution for the original problem, because it would result in using four rods of length $1$ to solve the original problem, violating the limit of two length-$1$ rods.\n\n\n15.3-6\n\n\n\n\nImagine that you wish to exchange one currency for another. You realize that instead of directly exchanging one currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the currency you want. Suppose that you can trade $n$ different currencies, numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where you start with currency $1$ and wish to wind up with currency $n$. You are given, for each pair of currencies $i$ and $j$ , an exchange rate $r_{ij}$, meaning that if you start with $d$ units of currency $i$ , you can trade for $dr_{ij}$ units of currency $j$. A sequence of trades may entail a commission, which depends on the number of trades you make. Let $c_k$ be the commission that you are charged when you make $k$ trades. Show that, if $c_k = 0$ for all $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ exhibits optimal substructure. Then show that if commissions $c_k$ are arbitrary values, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ does not necessarily exhibit optimal substructure.\n\n\n\n\nAny solution must add the additional assumption that no currency can be repeated in a sequence of trades. Without this assumption, if $r_{ij} > 1 / r_{ji}$ for some currencies $i$ and $j$, we could repeatedly exchange $i \\to j \\to i \\to j \\to \\cdot$ and make an unbounded profit.\n\n\nTo see that this problem has optimal substructure when $c_k = 0$ for all $k$, observe that the problem of exchanging currency $a$ for currency $b$ is equivalent to finding a sequence of currencies $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ such that $k_1 = a$, $k_m = b$ and the product $r_{k_1k_2}r_{k_2k_3}$ is maximized.\n\n\nWe use the usual cut-and-paste argument. Suppose that an optimal solution contains a sequence $\\langle k_i, k_{i + 1}, \\ldots, k_j \\rangle$ of currencies, and suppose that there exists a sequence $\\langle k_i', k_{i + 1}', \\ldots, k_j' \\rangle$, such that $k_i' = k_i$, $k_j' = k_j$, and $r_{k_i' k_{i + 1}'} \\cdots r_{k_{j - 1}' k_j'} > r_{k_i k_{i + 1}} \\cdots r_{k_{j - 1}k_j}$. Then we could substitute the sequence $\\langle k_i', k_{i + 1}', \\ldots, k_j' \\rangle$ for the sequence $\\langle k_i, k_{i + 1}, \\ldots, k_j \\rangle$ in the optimal solution to create an even better solution.\n\n\nWe show that optimal substructure does not hold when the $c_k$ are arbitrary values by means of an example. Suppose we have four currencies, with the following exchange rates:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\nr_{ij} &   1   &   2   &   3   & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n  1    &   1   &   2   & 5 / 2 & 6 \\\\\n  2    & 1 / 2 &   1   & 3 / 2 & 3 \\\\\n  3    & 2 / 5 & 2 / 3 &   1   & 3 \\\\\n  4    & 1 / 6 & 1 / 3 & 1 / 3 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\n\nLet $c_1 = 2$ and $c_2 = c_3 = 3$. Note that this example is not too badly contrived, in that $r_{ji} = 1 / r_{ij}$ for all $i$ and $j$.\n\n\nTo see how this example does not exhibit optimal substructure, let's examine an optimal solution for exchanging currency $1$ for currency $4$. There are five possible exchange sequences, with the following costs:\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\langle 1, 4       \\rangle & : 6 - 2                         & = 4, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 4    \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 - 3                 & = 3, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 3, 4    \\rangle & : 5 / 2 \\cdot 3 - 3             & = 9 / 2, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 3, 4 \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 / 2 \\cdot 3 - 3     & = 6, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 3, 2, 4 \\rangle & : 5 / 2 \\cdot 2 / 3 \\cdot 3 - 3 & = 2.\n\\end{array}\n\n\nThe optimal exchange sequence, $\\langle 1, 2, 3, 4 \\rangle$, appears in boldface.\n\n\nLet's examine the subproblem of exchanging currency $1$ for currency $3$. Allowing currency $4$ to be part of the exchange sequence, there are again five possible exchange sequences with the following costs and the optimal one in boldface:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\langle 1, 3       \\rangle & : 5 / 2 - 2                 & = 1 / 2, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 3    \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 / 2 - 3         & = 0, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 4, 3    \\rangle & : 6 \\cdot 1 / 3 - 3         & = -1, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 4, 3 \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 / 3 - 3 & = -1, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 4, 2, 3 \\rangle & : 6 \\cdot 1 / 3 \\cdot 3 / 2 & = 0.\n\\end{array}\n\n\nWe see that the solution to the original problem includes the subproblem of exchanging currency $1$ for currency $3$, yet the solution $\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$ to the subproblem used in the optimal solution to the original problem is not the optimal solution $\\langle 1, 3 \\rangle$ to the subproblem on its own.",

Justify your answer.   Running $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is asymptotically more efficient than enumerating all the ways of parenthesizing the product and computing the number of multiplications for each.  Consider the treatment of subproblems by the two approaches.   For each possible place to split the matrix chain, the enumeration approach \u00dends all ways to parenthesize the left half, finds all ways to parenthesize the right half, and looks at all possible combinations of the left half with the right half. The amount of work to look at each combination of left- and right-half subproblem results is thus the product of the number of ways to do the left half and the number of ways to do the right half.  For each possible place to split the matrix chain, $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ finds the best way to parenthesize the left half, finds the best way to parenthesize the right half, and combines just those two results. Thus the amount of work to combine the left- and right-half subproblem results is $O(1)$.   Section 15.2 argued that the running time for enumeration is $\\Omega(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$. We will show that the running time for $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is $O(n3^{n - 1})$.  To get an upper bound on the running time of $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$, we'll use the same approach used in Section 15.2 to get a lower bound: Derive a recurrence of the form $T(n) \\le \\ldots$ and solve it by substitution. For the lower-bound recurrence, the book assumed that the execution of lines 1\u20132 and 6\u20137 each take at least unit time. For the upper-bound recurrence, we'll assume those pairs of lines each take at most constant time $c$. Thus, we have the recurrence  $$\nT(n) \\le\n\\begin{cases}\n                                             c & \\text{if $n = 1$}, \\\\\nc + \\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} (T(k) + T(n - k) + c) & \\text{if $n \\ge 2$}. \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n$$  This is just like the book's $\\ge$ recurrence except that it has $c$ instead of $1$, and so we can be rewrite it as  $$T(n) \\le 2 \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} T(i) + cn.$$  We shall prove that $T(n) = O(n3^{n - 1})$ using the substitution method. (Note: Any upper bound on $T(n)$ that is $o(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$ will suffice. You might prefer to prove one that is easier to think up, such as $T(n) = O(3.5^n)$.) Specifically, we shall show that $T(n) \\le cn3^{n - 1}$ for all $n \\ge 1$. The basis is easy, since $T(1) \\le c = c \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3^{1 - 1}$ .  Inductively, for $n \\ge 2$ we have  \\begin{align}\nT(n) & \\le 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} T(i) + cn \\\\\n     & \\le 2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} ci 3^{i - 1} + cn \\\\\n     & \\le c \\cdot \\bigg(2\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1}i 3^{i - 1} + n\\bigg) \\\\\n     & =   c \\cdot \\bigg(2\\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{n 3^{n - 1}}{3 - 1} + \\frac{1 - 3^n}{(3 - 1)^2}\\bigg) + n\\bigg) & \\text{(see below)} \\\\\n     & =   cn 3^{n - 1} + c\\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{1 - 3^n}{2} + n\\bigg) \\\\\n     & =   cn 3^{n - 1} + \\frac{c}{2}(2n + 1 - 3^n) \\\\\n     & \\le cn 3^{n - 1} & \\text{for all $c > 0, n \\ge 1$}.\n\\end{align}  Running $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ takes $O(n3^{n - 1})$ time, and enumerating all parenthesizations takes $(4^n / n^{3 / 2})$ time, and so $\\text{RECURSIVE-MATRIX-CHAIN}$ is more efficient than enumeration.  Note: The above substitution uses the fact that  $$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} ix^{i - 1} = \\frac{nx^{n - 1}}{x - 1} + \\frac{1 - x^n}{(x - 1)^2}.$$  This equation can be derived from equation $\\text{(A.5)}$ by taking the derivative. Let  $$f(x) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} x^i = \\frac{x^n - 1}{x - 1} - 1.$$  Then  $$\\sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} ix^{i - 1} = f'(x) = \\frac{nx^{n - 1}}{x - 1} + \\frac{1 - x^n}{(x - 1)^2}.$$",

Professor Capulet claims that we do not always need to solve all the subproblems in order to find an optimal solution. She suggests that we can find an optimal solution to the matrix-chain multiplication problem by always choosing the matrix $A_k$ at which to split the subproduct $A_i A_{i + 1} \\cdots A_j$ (by selecting $k$ to minimize the quantity $p_{i - 1} p_k p_j$)  before  solving the subproblems. Find an instance of the matrix-chain multiplication problem for which this greedy approach yields a suboptimal solution.   Suppose that we are given matrices $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, and $A_4$ with dimensions such that  $$p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 = 1000, 100, 20, 10, 1000.$$  Then $p_0 p_k p_4$ is minimized when $k = 3$, so we need to solve the subproblem of multiplying $A_1 A_2 A_3$, and also $A_4$ which is solved automatically. By her algorithm, this is solved by splitting at $k = 2$. Thus, the full parenthesization is $(((A_1A_2)A_3)A_4)$.\nThis requires   $$1000 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 20 + 1000 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 = 12200000$$  scalar multiplications.  On the other hand, suppose we had fully parenthesized the matrices to multiply as $((A_1(A_2A_3))A_4)$. Then we would only require   $$100 \\cdot 20 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 10 + 1000 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 1000 = 11020000$$  scalar multiplications, which is fewer than Professor Capulet's method.

Show that the optimal-substructure property described in Section 15.1 no longer holds.   We say that a problem exhibits the optimal substructure property when optimal solutions to a problem incorporate optimal solutions to related subproblems,  which we may solve independently  (i.e., they do not share resources). When we impose a limit $l_i$ on the number of pieces of size $i$ that we are permitted to produce, the subproblems can no longer be solved  independently . For example, consider a rod of length $4$ with the following prices and limits:  \\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\text{length $i$}  &  1 &  2 &  3 &  4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{price $p_i$} & 15 & 20 & 33 & 36 \\\\\n\\text{limit $l_i$} &  2 &  1 &  1 &  1 \n\\end{array}  This instance has only three solutions that do not violate the limits: length $4$ with price $36$; lengths $1$ and $3$ with price $48$; and lengths $1$, $1$, and $2$ with price $50$. The optimal solution, therefore is to cut into lengths $1$, $1$, and $2$. When we look at the subproblem for length $2$, it has two solutions that do not violate the limits: length $2$ with price $20$, and lengths $1$ and $1$ with price $30$. The optimal solution for length $2$, therefore, is to cut into lengths $1$ and $1$. But we cannot use this optimal solution for the subproblem in the optimal solution for the original problem, because it would result in using four rods of length $1$ to solve the original problem, violating the limit of two length-$1$ rods.",

            "text": "Imagine that you wish to exchange one currency for another. You realize that instead of directly exchanging one currency for another, you might be better off making a series of trades through other currencies, winding up with the currency you want. Suppose that you can trade $n$ different currencies, numbered $1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where you start with currency $1$ and wish to wind up with currency $n$. You are given, for each pair of currencies $i$ and $j$ , an exchange rate $r_{ij}$, meaning that if you start with $d$ units of currency $i$ , you can trade for $dr_{ij}$ units of currency $j$. A sequence of trades may entail a commission, which depends on the number of trades you make. Let $c_k$ be the commission that you are charged when you make $k$ trades. Show that, if $c_k = 0$ for all $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ exhibits optimal substructure. Then show that if commissions $c_k$ are arbitrary values, then the problem of finding the best sequence of exchanges from currency $1$ to currency $n$ does not necessarily exhibit optimal substructure.   Any solution must add the additional assumption that no currency can be repeated in a sequence of trades. Without this assumption, if $r_{ij} > 1 / r_{ji}$ for some currencies $i$ and $j$, we could repeatedly exchange $i \\to j \\to i \\to j \\to \\cdot$ and make an unbounded profit.  To see that this problem has optimal substructure when $c_k = 0$ for all $k$, observe that the problem of exchanging currency $a$ for currency $b$ is equivalent to finding a sequence of currencies $k_1, k_2, \\ldots, k_m$ such that $k_1 = a$, $k_m = b$ and the product $r_{k_1k_2}r_{k_2k_3}$ is maximized.  We use the usual cut-and-paste argument. Suppose that an optimal solution contains a sequence $\\langle k_i, k_{i + 1}, \\ldots, k_j \\rangle$ of currencies, and suppose that there exists a sequence $\\langle k_i', k_{i + 1}', \\ldots, k_j' \\rangle$, such that $k_i' = k_i$, $k_j' = k_j$, and $r_{k_i' k_{i + 1}'} \\cdots r_{k_{j - 1}' k_j'} > r_{k_i k_{i + 1}} \\cdots r_{k_{j - 1}k_j}$. Then we could substitute the sequence $\\langle k_i', k_{i + 1}', \\ldots, k_j' \\rangle$ for the sequence $\\langle k_i, k_{i + 1}, \\ldots, k_j \\rangle$ in the optimal solution to create an even better solution.  We show that optimal substructure does not hold when the $c_k$ are arbitrary values by means of an example. Suppose we have four currencies, with the following exchange rates:  \\begin{array}{c|cccc}\nr_{ij} &   1   &   2   &   3   & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n  1    &   1   &   2   & 5 / 2 & 6 \\\\\n  2    & 1 / 2 &   1   & 3 / 2 & 3 \\\\\n  3    & 2 / 5 & 2 / 3 &   1   & 3 \\\\\n  4    & 1 / 6 & 1 / 3 & 1 / 3 & 1\n\\end{array}  Let $c_1 = 2$ and $c_2 = c_3 = 3$. Note that this example is not too badly contrived, in that $r_{ji} = 1 / r_{ij}$ for all $i$ and $j$.  To see how this example does not exhibit optimal substructure, let's examine an optimal solution for exchanging currency $1$ for currency $4$. There are five possible exchange sequences, with the following costs:\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\langle 1, 4       \\rangle & : 6 - 2                         & = 4, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 4    \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 - 3                 & = 3, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 3, 4    \\rangle & : 5 / 2 \\cdot 3 - 3             & = 9 / 2, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 3, 4 \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 / 2 \\cdot 3 - 3     & = 6, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 3, 2, 4 \\rangle & : 5 / 2 \\cdot 2 / 3 \\cdot 3 - 3 & = 2.\n\\end{array}  The optimal exchange sequence, $\\langle 1, 2, 3, 4 \\rangle$, appears in boldface.  Let's examine the subproblem of exchanging currency $1$ for currency $3$. Allowing currency $4$ to be part of the exchange sequence, there are again five possible exchange sequences with the following costs and the optimal one in boldface:  \\begin{array}{lll}\n\\langle 1, 3       \\rangle & : 5 / 2 - 2                 & = 1 / 2, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 3    \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 / 2 - 3         & = 0, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 4, 3    \\rangle & : 6 \\cdot 1 / 3 - 3         & = -1, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 2, 4, 3 \\rangle & : 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 / 3 - 3 & = -1, \\\\\n\\langle 1, 4, 2, 3 \\rangle & : 6 \\cdot 1 / 3 \\cdot 3 / 2 & = 0.\n\\end{array}  We see that the solution to the original problem includes the subproblem of exchanging currency $1$ for currency $3$, yet the solution $\\langle 1, 2, 3 \\rangle$ to the subproblem used in the optimal solution to the original problem is not the optimal solution $\\langle 1, 3 \\rangle$ to the subproblem on its own.",

Then show how to do the same thing, but using $\\min(m, n)$ entries plus $O(1)$ additional space.   When computing a particular row of the $c$ table, no rows before the previous row are needed. Thus only two rows\u2014$2\u00b7length[Y]$ entries\u2014need to be kept in memory at a time. (Note: Each row of $c$ actually has $length[Y] + 1$ entries, but we don't need to store the column of $0$'s\u2014instead we can make the program ''know'' that those entries are $0$.) With this idea, we need only $2 \\cdot \\min(m, n)$ entries if we always call $\\text{LCS-LENGTH}$ with the shorter sequence as the $Y$ argument.  We can thus do away with the $c$ table as follows:   Use two arrays of length $\\min(m, n)$, $previous\\text-row$ and $current\\text-row$, to hold the appropriate rows of $c$.  Initialize $previous\\text-row$ to all $0$ and compute $current\\text-row$ from left to right.  When $current\\text-row$ is filled, if there are still more rows to compute, copy $current\\text-row$ into $previous\\text-row$ and compute the new $current\\text-row$.

Initialize a to all $0$ and compute the entries from left to right.   Note that the 3 values needed to compute $c[i, j]$ for $j > 1$ are in $a[0] = c[i, j - 1], a[ j - 1] = c[i - 1, j - 1]$, and $a[ j] = c[i - 1, j]$.

            "text": "Suppose that we are given a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ with real-valued edge weights and two distinguished vertices $s$ and $t$ . Describe a dynamic-programming approach for finding a longest weighted simple path from $s$ to $t$ . What does the subproblem graph look like? What is the efficiency of your algorithm?\n\n\n\n\nWe will make use of the optimal substructure property of longest paths in acyclic graphs. Let $u$ be some vertex of the graph. If $u = t$, then the longest path from $u$ to $t$ has zero weight. If $u \\ne t$, let $p$ be a longest path from $u$ to $t$. Path $p$ has at least two vertices. Let $v$ be the second vertex on the path. Let $p'$ be the subpath of $p$ from $v$ to $t$ ($p'$ might be a zero-length path). That is, the path $p$ looks like\n\n\n$$u \\to v \\overset{p'}{\\leadsto} t.$$\n\n\nWe claim that $p'$ is a longest path from $v$ to $t$.\n\n\nTo prove the claim, we use a cut-and-paste argument. If $p'$ were not a longest path, then there exists a longer path $p''$ from $v$ to $t$. We could cut out $p'$ and paste in $p''$ to produce a path $u \\to v \\overset{p''}{\\leadsto} t$ which is longer than $p$, thus contradicting the assumption that $p$ is a longest path from $u$ to $t$.\n\n\nIt is important to note that the graph is \nacyclic\n. Because the graph is acyclic, path $p''$ cannot include the vertex u, for otherwise there would be a cycle of the form $u \\to v \\leadsto u$ in the graph. Thus, we can indeed use $p''$ to construct a longer path. The acyclicity requirement ensures that by pasting in path $p''$ , the overall path is still a \nsimple\n path (there is no cycle in the path). This difference between the cyclic and the acyclic case allows us to use dynamic programming to solve the acyclic case.\n\n\nLet $dist[u]$ denote the weight of a longest path from $u$ to $t$. The optimal substructure property allows us to write a recurrence for $dist[u]$ as\n\n\ndist[u] =\n\\begin{cases}\n                                           0 & \\text{if $u = t$}, \\\\\n\\max\\limits_{(u, v)\\in E}{w(u, v) + dist[v]} & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\n\nThis recurrence allows us to construct the following procedure:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nLONGEST\n-\nPATH\n-\nAUS\n(\nG\n,\n \nu\n,\n \nt\n,\n \ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nu\n \n==\n \nt\n\n        \ndist\n[\nu\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n        \nreturn\n \n(\ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n    \nelse\n \nif\n \nnext\n[\nu\n]\n \n\u2265\n \n0\n\n        \nreturn\n \n(\ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n    \nelse\n \nnext\n[\nu\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n        \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nu\n]\n\n            \n(\ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n \n=\n \nLONGEST\n-\nPATH\n-\nAUX\n(\nG\n,\n \nv\n,\n \nt\n,\n \ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n            \nif\n \nw\n(\nu\n,\n \nv\n)\n \n+\n \ndist\n[\nv\n]\n \n>\n \ndist\n[\nu\n]\n\n                \ndist\n[\nu\n]\n \n=\n \nw\n(\nu\n,\n \nv\n)\n \n+\n \ndist\n[\nv\n]\n\n                \nnext\n[\nu\n]\n \n=\n \nv\n\n    \nreturn\n \n(\ndist\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(See Section 22.1 for an explanation of the notation $G.Adj[u]$.)\n\n\n$\\text{LONGEST-PATH-AUX}$ is a memoized, recursive procedure, which returns the tuple $(dist, next)$. The array $dist$ is the memoized array that holds the solution to subproblems. That is, after the procedure returns, $dist[u]$ will hold the weight of a longest path from $u$ to $t$. The array $next$ serves two purposes:\n\n\n\n\nIt holds information necessary for printing out an actual path. Specifically, if $u$ is a vertex on the longest path that the procedure found, then $next[u]$ is the next vertex on the path.\n\n\nThe value in $next[u]$ is used to check whether the current subproblem has been solved earlier. A value of at least zero indicates that this subproblem has been solved earlier.\n\n\n\n\nThe first \nif\n condition checks for the base case $u = t$. The second \nif\n condition checks whether the current subproblem has already been solved. The \nfor\n loop iterates over each adjacent edge($u, v)$ and updates the longest distance in $dist[u]$.\n\n\nWhat is the running time of $\\text{LONGEST-PATH-AUX}$? Each subproblem represented by a vertex $u$ is solved at most once due to the memoization. For each vertex, we examine its adjacent edges. Thus, each edge is examined at most once, and the overall running time is $O(E)$. (Section 22.1 discusses how we achieve $O(E)$ time by representing the graph with adjacency lists.)\n\n\nThe $\\text{PRINT-PATH}$ procedure prints out the path using information stored in the next array:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nPRINT\n-\nPATH\n(\ns\n,\n \nt\n,\n \nnext\n)\n\n    \nu\n \n=\n \ns\n\n    \nprint\n \nu\n\n    \nwhile\n \nu\n \n!=\n \nt\n\n        \nprint\n \n\"\u2192\"\n \nnext\n[\nu\n]\n\n        \nu\n \n=\n \nnext\n[\ni\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $\\text{LONGEST-PATH-MAIN}$ procedure is the main driver.

Thus, it follows that $m > 2$. If $z_1 \\ne x_1$, then we could append $x_1 = x_n$ to the ends of $Z$ to obtain a palindrome subsequence of $X$ with length $m + 2$, contradicting the supposition that $Z$ is a longest palindrome subsequence of $X$. Thus, we must have $z_1 = x_1 (= x_n = zm)$. Now, $Z_{2, m - 1}$ is a length-$(m - 2)$ palindrome subsequence of $X_{2, n - 1}$. We wish to show that it is an $\\text{LPS}$. Suppose for the purpose of contradiction that there exists a palindrome subsequence $W$ of $X_{2, n - 1}$ with length greater than $m - 2$. Then, appending $x_1 = x_n$ to the ends of $W$ produces a palindrome subsequence of $X$ whose length is greater than $m$, which is a contradiction.\n\n\nIf $z_1 \\ne x_1$, then $Z$ is a palindrome subsequence of $X_{2, n}$. If there were a palindrome subsequence $W$ of $X_{2, n}$ with length greater than $m$, then $W$ would also be a palindrome subsequence of $X$, contradicting the assumption that $Z$ is an $\\text{LPS}$ of $X$.\n\n\nThe proof is symmetric to (2).\n\n\n\n\nThe way that the theorem characterizes longest palindrome subsequences tells us that an $\\text{LPS}$ of a sequence contains within it an $\\text{LPS}$ of a subsequence of the sequence. Thus, the $\\text{LPS}$ problem has an optimal-substructure property.\n\n\nStep 2: A recursive solution\n\n\nThe theorem implies that we should examine either one or two subproblems when finding an $\\text{LPS}$ of $X = \\langle x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\rangle$, depending on whether $x_1 = x_n$.\n\n\nLet us define $p[i, j]$  to be the length of an $\\text{LPS}$ of the subsequence $X_{ij}$. If $i = j$, the $\\text{LPS}$ has length $1$. If $j = i + 1$, then the $\\text{LPS}$ has length either $1$ or $2$, depending on whether $x_i = x_j$. The optimal substructure of the $\\text{LPS}$ problem gives the following recursive formula:\n\n\n$$\np[i, j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n1                   & \\text{if $i = j$}, \\\\\n2                   & \\text{if $j = i + 1$ and $x_i = x_j$}, \\\\\n1                   & \\text{if $j = i + 1$ and $x_i \\ne x_j$}, \\\\\np[i + 1, j - 1] + 2 & \\text{if $j > i + 1$ and $x_i = x_j$}, \\\\\n\\max(p[i, j - 1], p[i + 1, j]) & \\text{if $j > i + 1$ and $x_i \\ne x_j$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nStep 3: Computing the length of an LPS\n\n\nProcedure $\\text{LONGEST-PALINDROME}$ takes a sequence $X = \\langle x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\rangle$ as input. The procedure fills cells $p[i, i]$, where $1 \\le i \\le n$, and $p[i, i + 1]$, where $1 \\le i \\le n - 1$, as the base cases. It then starts filling cells $p[i, j]$, where $j > i + 1$. The procedure fills the $p$ table row by row, starting with row $n - 2$ and moving toward row $1$. (Rows $n - 1$ and $n$ are already filled as part of the base cases.) Within each row, the procedure fills the entries from left to right. The procedure also maintains the table $b[1..n, 1..n]$ to help us construct an optimal solution. Intuitively, $b[i, j]$ points to the table entry corresponding to the optimal subproblem solution chosen when computing $p[i, j]$. The procedure returns the $b$ and $p$ tables, $p[1, n]$ contains the length of an $\\text{LPS}$ of $X$.

            "text": "In the \neuclidean traveling-salesman problem\n, we are given a set of $n$ points in the plane, and we wish to find the shortest closed tour that connects all n points. Figure 15.11(a) shows the solution to a $7$-point problem. The general problem is NP-hard, and its solution is therefore believed to require more than polynomial time (see Chapter 34).\n\n\nJ. L. Bentley has suggested that we simplify the problem by restricting our attention to \nbitonic tours\n, that is, tours that start at the leftmost point, go strictly rightward to the rightmost point, and then go strictly leftward back to the starting point. Figure 15.11(b) shows the shortest bitonic tour of the same $7$ points. In this case, a polynomial-time algorithm is possible.\n\n\nDescribe an $O(n^2)$-time algorithm for determining an optimal bitonic tour. You may assume that no two points have the same $x$-coordinate and that all operations on real numbers take unit time. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Scan left to right, maintaining optimal possibilities for the two parts of the tour.)\n\n\n\n\nTaking the book's hint, we sort the points by $x$-coordinate, left to right, in $O(n\\lg n)$ time. Let the sorted points be, left to right, $\\langle p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_n \\rangle$. Therefore, $p_1$ is the leftmost point, and $p_n$ is the rightmost.\n\n\nWe define as our subproblems paths of the following form, which we call bitonic paths. A \nbitonic path\n $P_{i, j}$, where $i \\le j$, includes all points $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_j$; it starts at some point $p_i$, goes strictly left to point $p_1$, and then goes strictly right to point $p_j$. By \"going strictly left,\" we mean that each point in the path has a lower $x$-coordinate than the previous point. Looked at another way, the indices of the sorted points form a strictly decreasing sequence. Likewise, \"going strictly right\" means that the indices of the sorted points form a strictly increasing sequence. Moreover, $P_{i, j}$ contains all the points $p_1, p_2, p_3, \\ldots, p_j$ Note that $p_j$ is the rightmost point in $P_{i, j}$ and is on the rightgoing subpath. The leftgoing subpath may be degenerate, consisting of just $p_1$.\n\n\nLet us denote the euclidean distance between any two points $p_i$ and $p_j$ by $|p_i p_j|$. And let us denote by $b[i, j]$, for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$, the length of the shortest bitonic path $P_{i, j}$. Since the leftgoing subpath may be degenerate, we can easily compute all values $b[1, j]$. The only value of $b[i, i]$ that we will need is $b[n, n]$, which is the length of the shortest bitonic tour. We have the following formulation of $b[i, j]$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le n$:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nb[1, 2] & = |p_1 p_2|, \\\\\nb[i, j] & = b[i, j - 1] + |p_{j - 1} p_j| & \\text{for $i < j - 1$}, \\\\\nb[j - 1, j] & = \\min_{1\\le k < j - 1} \\{b[k, j - 1] + |p_k p_j|\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWhy are these formulas correct? Any bitonic path ending at $p_2$ has $p_2$ as its rightmost point, so it consists only of $p_1$ and $p_2$. Its length, therefore, is $|p_1 p_2|$.\n\n\nNow consider a shortest bitonic path $P_{i, j}$. The point $p_{j - 1}$ is somewhere on this path. If it is on the rightgoing subpath, then it immediately preceeds $p_j$ on this subpath. Otherwise, it is on the leftgoing subpath, and it must be the rightmost point on this subpath, so $i = j - 1$. In the first case, the subpath from $p_i$ to $p_{j - 1}$ must be a shortest bitonic path $P_{i, j - 1}$, for otherwise we could use a cut-and-paste argument to come up with a shorter bitonic path than $P_{i, j}$. (This is part of our optimal substructure.) The length of $P_{i, j}$, therefore, is given by $b[i, j - 1] + |p_{j - 1} p_j|$. In the second case, $p_j$ has an immediate predecessor $p_k$, where $k < j - 1$, on the rightgoing subpath. Optimal substructure again applies: the subpath from $p_k$ to $p_{j - 1}$ must be a shortest bitonic path $P_{k, j - 1}$, for otherwise we could use cut-and-paste to come up with a shorter bitonic path than $P_{i, j}$. (We have implicitly relied on paths having the same length regardless of which direction we traverse them.) The length of $P_{i, j}$, therefore, is given by $\\min_{1 \\le k \\le j - 1} \\{b[k, j - 1] + |p_k p_j|\\}$.\n\n\nWe need to compute $b[n, n]$. In an optimal bitonic tour, one of the points adjacent to $p_n$ must be $p_{n - 1}$, and so we have\n\n\n$$b[n, n] = b[n - 1, n] + |p_{n - 1} p_n|.$$\n\n\nTo reconstruct the points on the shortest bitonic tour, we define $r[i, j]$ to be the index of the immediate predecessor of $p_j$ on the shortest bitonic path $P_{i, j}$. Because the immediate predecessor of $p_2$ on $P_{1, 2}$ is $p_1$, we know that $r[1, 2]$ must be $1$. The pseudocode below shows how we compute $b[i, j]$ and $r[i, j]$. It fills in only entries $b[i, j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le n - 1$ and $i + 1 \\le j \\le n$, or where $i = j = n$, and only entries $r[i, j]$ where $1 \\le i \\le n - 2$ and $i + 2 \\le j \\le n$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\nEUCLIDEAN\n-\nTSP\n(\np\n)\n\n    \nsort\n \nthe\n \npoints\n \nso\n \nthat\n \n\u27e8\np1\n,\n \np2\n,\n \np3\n,...,\n \npn\n\u27e9\n \nare\n \nin\n \norder\n \nof\n \nincreasing\n \nx\n-\ncoordinate\n\n    \nlet\n \nb\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n,\n \n2.\n.\nn\n]\n \nand\n \nr\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n \n-\n \n2\n,\n \n3.\n.\nn\n]\n \nbe\n \nnew\n \narrays\n\n    \nb\n[\n1\n,\n \n2\n]\n \n=\n \n|\np1p2\n|\n\n    \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n3\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nj\n \n-\n \n2\n\n            \nb\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nb\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \n|\np\n(\nj\n \n-\n \n1\n)\npj\n|\n\n            \nr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nj\n \n-\n \n1\n\n        \nb\n[\nj\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n        \nfor\n \nk\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nj\n \n-\n \n2\n\n            \nq\n \n=\n \nb\n[\nk\n,\n \nj\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \n|\npkpj\n|\n\n            \nif\n \nq\n \n<\n \nb\n[\nj\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n                \nb\n[\nj\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nq\n\n                \nr\n[\nj\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nk\n\n    \nb\n[\nn\n,\n \nn\n]\n \n=\n \nb\n[\nn\n \n-\n \n1\n,\n \nn\n]\n \n+\n \n|\np\n(\nn\n \n-\n \n1\n)\npn\n|\n\n    \nreturn\n \nb\n \nand\n \nr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe print out the tour we found by starting at $p_n$, then a leftgoing subpath that includes $p_{n - 1}$, from right to left, until we hit $p_1$.

            "text": "Consider the problem of neatly printing a paragraph with a monospaced font (all characters having the same width) on a printer. The input text is a sequence of $n$ words of lengths $l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n$, measured in characters. We want to print this paragraph neatly on a number of lines that hold a maximum of $M$ characters each. Our criterion of \"neatness\" is as follows. If a given line contains words $i$ through $j$, where $i \\le j$ , and we leave exactly one space between words, the number of extra space characters at the end of the line is $M - j + i - \\sum_{k = i}^j l_k$, which must be nonnegative so that the words fit on the line. We wish to minimize the sum, over all lines except the last, of the cubes of the numbers of extra space characters at the ends of lines. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to print a paragraph of $n$ words neatly on a printer. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nNote: We assume that no word is longer than will fit into a line, i.e., $l_i \\le M$ for all $i$.\n\n\nFirst, we'll make some definitions so that we can state the problem more uniformly. Special cases about the last line and worries about whether a sequence of words fits in a line will be handled in these definitions, so that we can forget about them when framing our overall strategy.\n\n\n\n\nDefine $extras[i, j] = M - j + i - \\sum_{k = i}^j l_k$ to be the number of extra spaces at the end of a line containing words $i$ through $j$. Note that $extras$ may be negative.\n\n\n\n\nNow define the cost of including a line containing words $i$ through $j$ in the sum we want to minimize:\n\n\n$$\nlc[i, j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n          \\infty & \\text{if $extras[i, j] < 0$ (i.e., words $i, \\ldots, j$ don't fit)}, \\\\\n               0 & \\text{if $j = n$ and $extras[i, j] \\ge 0$ (last line costs $0$)}, \\\\\n(extras[i, j])^3 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy making the line cost infinite when the words don't fit on it, we prevent such an arrangement from being part of a minimal sum, and by making the cost $0$ for the last line (if the words fit), we prevent the arrangement of the last line from influencing the sum being minimized.\n\n\nWe want to minimize the sum of $lc$ over all lines of the paragraph.\n\n\nOur subproblems are how to optimally arrange words $1, \\ldots, j$, where $j = 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\nConsider an optimal arrangement of words $1, \\ldots, j$. Suppose we know that the last line, which ends in word $j$, begins with word $i$. The preceding lines, therefore, contain words $1, \\ldots, i - 1$. In fact, they must contain an optimal arrangement of words $1, \\ldots, i - 1$. (The usual type of cut-and-paste argument applies.)\n\n\nLet $c[j]$  be the cost of an optimal arrangement of words $1, \\ldots, j$. If we know that the last line contains words $i, \\ldots, j$, then $c[j] = c[i - 1] + lc[i, j]$. As a base case, when we're computing $c[1]$, we need $c[0]$. If we set $c[0] = 0$, then $c[1] = lc[1, 1]$, which is what we want.\n\n\nBut of course we have to figure out which word begins the last line for the subproblem of words $1, \\ldots, j$. So we try all possibilities for word $i$, and we pick the one that gives the lowest cost. Here, $i$ ranges from $1$ to $j$. Thus, we can define $c[j]$ recursively by\n\n\n$$\nc[j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n                                                0 & \\text{if $j = 0$}, \\\\\n\\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le j} (c[i - 1] + lc[i, j]) & \\text{if $j > 0$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nNote that the way we defined $lc$ ensures that\n\n\n\n\nall choices made will fit on the line (since an arrangement with $lc = \\infty$ cannot be chosen as the minimum), and\n\n\nthe cost of putting words $i, \\ldots, j$ on the last line will not be $0$ unless this really is the last line of the paragraph ($j = n$) or words $i, \\ldots, j$ fill the entire line.\n\n\n\n\nWe can compute a table of $c$ values from left to right, since each value depends only on earlier values.\n\n\nTo keep track of what words go on what lines, we can keep a parallel $p$ table that points to where each $c$ value came from. When $c[j]$ is computed, if $c[j]$ is based on the value of $c[k - 1]$, set $p[j] = k$. Then after $c[n]$ is computed, we can trace the pointers to see where to break the lines. The last line starts at word $p[n]$ and goes through word $n$. The previous line starts at word $p[p[n]]$ and goes through word $p[n] - 1$, et.\n\n\nIn pseudocode, here's how we construct the tables:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nPRINT\n-\nNEATLY\n(\nl\n,\n \nn\n,\n \nM\n)\n\n    \nlet\n \nextras\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n,\n \n1.\n.\nn\n],\n \nlc\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n,\n \n1.\n.\nn\n],\n \nand\n \nc\n[\n0.\n.\nn\n]\n \nbe\n \nnew\n \narrays\n   \n    \n// Compute extras[i, j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \ni\n]\n \n=\n \nM\n \n-\n \nli\n\n        \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n+\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n            \nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n-\n \nlj\n \n-\n \n1\n\n    \n// Compute lc[i, j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \nto\n \nn\n\n            \nif\n \nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n<\n \n0\n\n                \nlc\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n            \nelse\n \nif\n \nj\n \n==\n \nn\n \nand\n \nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n\u2265\n \n0\n\n                \nlc\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n            \nelse\n \nlc\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \npow\n((\nextras\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]),\n \n3\n)\n\n    \n// Compute c[j] and p[j] for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\n    \nc\n[\n0\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n    \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nc\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nj\n\n            \nif\n \nc\n[\ni\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \nlc\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n<\n \nc\n[\nj\n]\n\n                \nc\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \nc\n[\ni\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \nlc\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n                \np\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \ni\n\n    \nreturn\n \nc\n \nand\n \np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuite clearly, both the time and space are $\\Theta(n^2)$.\n\n\nIn fact, we can do a bit better: we can get both the time and space down to $\\Theta(nM)$. The key observation is that at most $\\lceil M / 2 \\rceil$ words can fit on a line. (Each word is at least one character long, and there's a space between words.) Since a line with words $i, \\ldots, j$ contains $j - i + 1$ words, if $j - i + 1 > \\lceil M / 2 \\rceil$ then we know that $lc[i, j] = \\infty$. We need only compute and store $extras[i, j]$ and $lc[i, j]$ for $j - i + 1 \\le \\lceil M / 2 \\rceil$. And the inner \nfor\n loop header in the computation of $c[j]$ and $p[j]$ can run from $\\max(1, j - \\lceil M / 2 \\rceil + 1)$ to $j$.\n\n\nWe can reduce the space even further to $\\Theta(n)$. We do so by not storing the $lc$ and $extras$ tables, and instead computing the value of $lc[i, j]$ as needed in the last loop. The idea is that we could compute $lc[i, j]$ in $O(1)$ time if we knew the value of $extras[i, j]$. And if we scan for the minimum value in \ndescending\n order of $i$, we can compute that as $extras[i, j] = extras[i + 1, j] - l_i - 1$. (Initially, $extras[j, j] = M - l_j$.) This improvement reduces the space to $\\Theta(n)$, since now the only tables we store are $c$ and $p$.\n\n\nHere's how we print which words are on which line. The printed output of $\\text{GIVE-LINES}(p, j)$ is a sequence of triples $(k, i, j)$, indicating that words $i, \\ldots, j$ are printed on line $k$. The return value is the line number $k$.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nGIVE\n-\nLINES\n(\np\n,\n \nj\n)\n\n    \ni\n \n=\n \np\n[\nj\n]\n\n    \nif\n \ni\n \n==\n \n1\n\n        \nk\n \n=\n \n1\n\n    \nelse\n \nk\n \n=\n \nGIVE\n-\nLINES\n(\np\n,\n \ni\n \n-\n \n1\n)\n \n+\n \n1\n\n    \nprint\n(\nk\n,\n \ni\n,\n \nj\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial call is $\\text{GIVE-LINES}(p, n)$.

            "text": "In order to transform one source string of text $x[1..m]$ to a target string $y[1..n]$, we can perform various transformation operations. Our goal is, given $x$ and $y$, to produce a series of transformations that change $x$ to $y$. We use an array $z$\u2014assumed to be large enough to hold all the characters it will need\u2014to hold the intermediate results. Initially, $z$ is empty, and at termination, we should have $z[j] = y[j]$ for $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. We maintain current indices $i$ into $x$ and $j$ into $z$, and the operations are allowed to alter $z$ and these indices. Initially, $i = j = 1$. We are required to examine every character in $x$ during the transformation, which means that at the end of the sequence of transformation operations, we must have $i = m + 1$.\n\n\nWe may choose from among six transformation operations:\n\n\nCopy\n a character from $x$ to $z$ by setting $z[j] = x[i]$ and then incrementing both $i$ and $j$. This operation examines $x[i]$.\n\n\nReplace\n a character from $x$ by another character $c$, by setting $z[j] = c$, and then incrementing both $i$ and $j$. This operation examines $x[i]$.\n\n\nDelete\n a character from $x$ by incrementing $i$ but leaving $j$ alone. This operation examines $x[i]$.\n\n\nInsert\n the character $c$ into $z$ by setting $z[j] = c$ and then incrementing $j$, but leaving $i$ alone. This operation examines no characters of $x$.\n\n\nTwiddle\n (i.e., exchange) the next two characters by copying them from $x$ to $z$ but in the opposite order; we do so by setting $z[j] = x[i + 1]$ and $z[j + 1] = x[i]$ and then setting $i = i + 2$ and $j = j + 2$. This operation examines $x[i]$ and $x[i + 1]$.\n\n\nKill\n the remainder of $x$ by setting $i = m + 1$. This operation examines all characters in $x$ that have not yet been examined. This operation, if performed, must be the final operation.\n\n\nAs an example, one way to transform the source string $\\text{algorithm}$ to the target string $\\text{altruistic}$ is to use the following sequence of operations, where the underlined characters are $x[i]$ and $z[j]$  after the operation:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\text{Operation}         & x           & z \\\\\n\\hline\n\\textit{initial strings} & \\underline algorithm & \\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{copy}              & a\\underline lgorithm & a\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{copy}              & al\\underline gorithm & al\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{replace by $t$}    & alg\\underline orithm & alt\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{delete}            & algo\\underline rithm & alt\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{copy}              & algor\\underline ithm & altr\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{insert $u$}        & algor\\underline ithm & altru\\text{_} \\\\\n\\text{insert $i$}        & algor\\underline ithm & altrui\\text{_}\\\\\n\\text{insert $s$}        & algor\\underline ithm & altruis\\text{_}\\\\\n\\text{twiddle}           & algorit\\underline hm & altruisti\\text{_}\\\\\n\\text{insert $c$}        & algorit\\underline hm & altruistic\\text{_}\\\\\n\\text{kill}              & algorithm\\text{_} & altruistic\\text{_}\n\\end{array}\n\n\nNote that there are several other sequences of transformation operations that transform $\\text{algorithm}$ to $\\text{altruistic}$.\n\n\nEach of the transformation operations has an associated cost. The cost of an operation depends on the specific application, but we assume that each operation's cost is a constant that is known to us. We also assume that the individual costs of the copy and replace operations are less than the combined costs of the delete and insert operations; otherwise, the copy and replace operations would not be used. The cost of a given sequence of transformation operations is the sum of the costs of the individual operations in the sequence. For the sequence above, the cost of transforming $\\text{algorithm}$ to $\\text{altruistic}$ is\n\n\n$$\\text{($3 \\cdot$ cost(copy)) + cost(replace) + cost(delete) + ($4 \\cdot$ cost(insert)) + cost(twiddle) + cost(kill)}.$$\n\n\na.\n Given two sequences $x[1..m]$ and $y[1..n]$ and set of transformation-operation costs, the \nedit distance\n from $x$ to $y$ is the cost of the least expensive operatoin sequence that transforms $x$ to $y$. Describe a dynamic-programming algorithm that finds the edit distance from $x[1..m]$ to $y[1..n]$ and prints an optimal opeartion sequence. Analyze the running time and space requirements of your algorithm.\n\n\nThe edit-distance problem generalizes the problem of aligning two DNA sequences (see, for example, Setubal and Meidanis [310, Section 3.2]). There are several methods for measuring the similarity of two DNA sequences by aligning them. One such method to align two sequences $x$ and $y$ consists of inserting spaces at arbitrary locations in the two sequences (including at either end) so that the resulting sequences $x'$ and $y'$ have the same length but do not have a space in the same position (i.e., for no position $j$ are both $x'[j]$ and $y'[j]$ a space). Then we assign a ''score'' to each position. Position $j$ receives a score as follows:\n\n\n\n\n$+1$ if $x'[j] = y'[j]$ and neither is a space,\n\n\n$-1$ if $x'[j] \\ne y'[j]$ and neither is a space,\n\n\n$-2$ if either $x'[j]$ or $y'[j]$ is a space.\n\n\n\n\nThe score for the alignment is the sum of the scores of the individual positions. For example, given the sequences $x = \\text{GATCGGCAT}$ and $y = \\text{CAATGTGAATC}$, one alignment is\n\n\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n\\text G &         & \\text A & \\text T & \\text C & \\text G &         & \\text G & \\text C & \\text A & \\text T & \\\\\n\\text C & \\text A & \\text A & \\text T &         & \\text G & \\text T & \\text G & \\text A & \\text A & \\text T & \\text C \\\\\n-       & *       & +       & +       & *       & +       & *       & +       & -       & +       & +       & * \n\\end{array}\n\n\nA $+$ under a position indicates a score of $+1$ for that position, a $-$ indicates a score of $-1$, and a $*$ indicates a score of $-2$, so that this alignment has a total score of $6 \\cdot -2 \\cdot 1 - 4 \\cdot 2 = -4$.\n\n\nb.\n Explain how to cast the problem of finding an optimal alignment as an edit distance problem using a subset of the transformation operations copy, replace, delete, insert, twiddle, and kill.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Dynamic programming is the ticket. This problem is slightly similar to the longest-common-subsequence problem. In fact, we'll define the notational conveniences $X_i$ and $Y_j$ in the similar manner as we did for the LCS problem: $X_i = x[1..i]$ and $Y_j = y[1..j]$.\n\n\nOur subproblems will be determining an optimal sequence of operations that converts $X_i$ to $Y_j$, for $0 \\le i \\le m$ and $0 \\le j \\le n$. We'll call this the ''$X_i \\to Y_j$ problem.'' The original problem is the $X_m \\to Y_n$ problem.\n\n\nLet's suppose for the moment that we know what was the last operation used to convert $X_i$ to $Y_j$. There are six possibilities. We denote by $c[i, j]$ the cost of an optimal solution to the $X_i \\to Y_j$ problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the last operation was a \ncopy\n, then we must have had $x[i] = y[j]$. The subproblem that remains is converting $X_{i - 1}$ to $Y_{j - 1}$. And an optimal solution to the $X_i \\to Y_j$ problem must include an optimal solution to the $X_{i - 1} \\to Y_{j - 1}$ problem. The cut-and-paste argument applies. Thus, assuming that the last operation was a copy, we have\n\n\n$$c[i, j] = c[i - 1, j - 1] + \\text{cost(copy)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it was a \nreplace\n, then we must have had $x[i] \\ne y[j]$. (Here, we assume that we cannot replace a character with itself. It is a straightforward modification if we allow replacement of a character with itself.) We have the same optimal substructure argument as for copy, and assuming that the last operation was a replace, we have\n\n\n$$c[i, j] = c[i - 1, j - 1] + \\text{cost(replace)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it was a \ntwiddle\n, then we must have had both $x[i] = y[j - 1]$ and $x[i - 1] = y[j]$, along with the implicit assumption that $i, j \\ge 2$. Now our subproblem is $X_{i - 2} \\to Y_{j - 2}$ and, assuming that the last operation was a twiddle, we have\n\n\n$$c[i, j] = c[i - 2, j - 2] + \\text{cost(twiddle)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it was a \ndelete\n, then we have no restrictions on $x$ or $y$. Since we can view delete as removing a character from $X_i$ and leaving $Y_j$ alone, our subproblem is $X_{i - 1} \\to Y_j$. Assuming that the last operation was a delete, we have\n\n\n$$c[i, j] = c[i - 1, j] + \\text{cost(delete)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it was an \ninsert\n, then we have no restrictions on $x$ or $y$. Our subproblem is $X_ i \\to Y_{j - 1}$. Assuming that the last operation was an insert, we have\n\n\n$$c[i, j] = c[i, j - 1] + \\text{cost(insert)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it was a \nkill\n, then we had to have completed converting $X_m$ to $Y_n$, so that the current problem must be the $X_m \\to Y_n$ problem. In other words, we must have $i = m$ and $j = n$. If we think of a kill as a multiple delete, we can get any $X_i \\to Y_n$, where $0 \\le i < m$, as a subproblem. We pick the best one, and so assuming that the last operation was a kill, we have\n\n\n$$c[m, n] = \\min_{0 \\le i < m}{c[i, n]} + \\text{cost(kill)}.$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have not handled the base cases, in which $i = 0$ or $j = 0$. These are easy. $X_0$ and $Y_0$ are the empty strings. We convert an empty string into $Y_j$ by a sequence of $j$ inserts, so that $c[0, j] = j \\cdot \\text{cost(insert)}$. Similarly, we convert $X_i$ into $Y_0$ by a sequence of $i$ deletes, so that $c[i, 0] = i \\cdot \\text{cost(delete)}$. When $i = j = 0$, either formula gives us $c[0, 0] = 0$, which makes sense, since there's no cost to convert the empty string to the empty string.\n\n\nFor $i, j > 0$, our recursive formulation for $c[i, j]$ applies the above formulas in the situations in which they hold:\n\n\n$$\nc[i, j] = \\min\n\\begin{cases}\nc[i - 1, j - 1] + \\text{cost(copy)}                     & \\text{if $x[i] = y[j]$}, \\\\\nc[i - 1, j - 1] + \\text{cost(replace)}                  & \\text{if $x[i] \\ne y[j]$}, \\\\\nc[i - 2, j - 2] + \\text{cost(twiddle)}                  & \\text{if $i, j \\ge 2$}, \\\\\n                                                        & x[i] = y[j - 1], \\\\\n                                                        & \\text{and $x[i - 1] = y[j]$}, \\\\\nc[i - 1, j] + \\text{cost(delete)}                       & \\text{always}, \\\\\nc[i, j] = c[i, j - 1] + \\text{cost(insert)}             & \\text{always}, \\\\\n\\min\\limits_{0 \\le i < m} {c[i, n]} + \\text{cost(kill)} & \\text{if $i = m$ and $j = n$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nLike we did for LCS, our pseudocode fills in the table in row-major order, i.e., row-by-row from top to bottom, and left to right within each row. Columnmajor order (column-by-column from left to right, and top to bottom within each column) would also work.

In order to make the party fun for all attendees, the president does not want both an employee and his or her immediate supervisor to attend. \n\n\nProfessor Stewart is given the tree that describes the structure of the corporation, using the left-child, right-sibling representation described in Section 10.4. Each node of the tree holds, in addition to the pointers, the name of an employee and that employee's conviviality ranking. Describe an algorithm to make up a guest list that maximizes the sum of the conviviality ratings of the guests. Analyze the running time of your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem exhibits optimal substructure in the following way: If the root $r$ is included in an optimal solution, then we must solve the optimal subproblems rooted at the grandchildren of $r$. If $r$ is not included, then we must solve the optimal subproblems on trees rooted at the children of $r$. The dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem works as follows: We make a table $C$ indexed by vertices which tells us the optimal conviviality ranking of a guest list obtained from the subtree with root at that vertex. We also make a table $G$ such that $G[i]$ tells us the guest list we would use when vertex $i$ is at the root. Let $T$ be the tree of guests. To solve the problem, we need to examine the guest list stored at $G[T.root]$. First solve the problem at each leaf $L$. If the conviviality ranking at $L$ is positive, $G[L] = {L}$ and $C[L] = L.conviv$. Otherwise $G[L] = \\emptyset$ and $C[L] = 0$. Iteratively solve the subproblems located at parents of nodes at which the subproblem has been solved. In general for a node $x$,\n\n\n$$C[x] = \\min(\\sum_{y\\text{ is a child of } x} C[y], \\sum_{y\\text{ is a grandchild of } x} C[y]).$$\n\n\nThe runtime of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices, because we solve $n$ subproblems, each in constant time, but the tree traversals required to find the appropriate next node to solve could take linear time.",

            "text": "We are given a color picture consisting of an $m \\times n$ array $A[1..m, 1..n]$ of pixels, where each pixel specifies a triple of red, green, and blue (RGB) intensities. Suppose that we wish to compress this picture slightly. Specifically, we wish to remove one pixel from each of the $m$ rows, so that the whole picture becomes one pixel narrower. To avoid disturbing visual effects, however, we require that the pixels removed in two adjacent rows be in the same or adjacent columns; the pixels removed form a ''seam'' from the top row to the bottom row where successive pixels in the seam are adjacent vertically or diagonally.\n\n\na.\n Show that the number of such possible seams grows at least exponentially in $m$, assuming that $n > 1$.\n\n\nb.\n Suppose now that along with each pixel $A[i, j]$, we have calculated a real-valued disruption measure $d[i, j]$, indicating how disruptive it would be to remove pixel $A[i, j]$. Intuitively, the lower a pixel's disruption measure, the more similar the pixel is to its neighbors. Suppose further that we define the disruption measure of a seam to be the sum of the disruption measures of its pixels.\n\n\nGive an algorithm to find a seam with the lowest disruption measure. How efficient is your algorithm?\n\n\n\n\na.\n  Let us set up a recurrence for the number of valid seams as a function of $m$. Suppose we are in the process of carving out a seam row by row, starting from the first row. Let the last pixel carved out be $A[i, j]$. How many choices do we have for the pixel in row $i + 1$ such that the pixel continues the seam? If the last pixel $A[i, j]$ were on the column boundary ($i = 1$ or $i = n$), then there would be two choices for the next pixel. For example, when $i = 1$, the two choices for the next pixel are $A[i + 1, j]$ and $A[i + 1, j + 1]$. Otherwise, there would be three choices for the next pixel: $A[i + 1, j - 1], A[i + 1, j], A[i + 1, j + 1]$. Thus, for a general pixel $A[i, j]$, there are at least two possible choices for a pixel $p$ in the next row such that $p$ continues a seam ending in $A[i, j]$. Let $T(i)$ denote the number of possible seams from row $1$ to row $i$. Then, for $i = 1$, we have $T(i) = n$, and for $i > 1$,\n\n\n$$T(i) \\ge 2T(i - 1).$$\n\n\nIt is easy to guess that $T(i) \\ge n2^{n - 1}$, which we verify by direct substitution. For $i = 1$, we have $T(i) = n \\ge n \\cdot 2^0$. For $i > 1$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(i) & \\ge 2T(i - 1) \\\\\n     & \\ge 2 \\cdot n 2^{i - 1} \\\\\n     & =   n 2^{i - 1}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the total number $T(m)$ of seams is at least $n2^{m - 1}$. We conclude that the number of seams grows at least exponentially in $m$.\n\n\nb.\n As proved in the previous part, it is infeasible to systematically check every seam, since the number of possible seams grows exponentially.\n\n\nThe structure of the problem allows us to build the solution row by row. Consider a pixel $A[i, j]$. We ask the question: 'If $i$ were the first row of the picture, what is the minimum disruptive measure of seams that start with the pixel $A[i, j]$?'\n\n\nLet $S^*$ be a seam of minimum disruptive measure among all seams that start with pixel $A[i, j]$. Let $A[i + 1, p]$, where $p \\in {j - 1, j, j + 1}$, be the pixel of $S^*$ in the next row. Let $S'$ be the sub-seam of $S^*$ that starts with $A[i + 1, p]$. We claim that $S'$ has the minimum disruptive measure among seams that start with $A[i + 1, p]$. Why? Suppose there exists another seam $S''$ that starts with $A[i + 1, p]$ and has disruptive measure less than that of $S'$. By using $S''$ as the sub-seam instead of $S'$, we can obtain another seam that starts with $A[i, j]$ and has a disruptive measure which is less than that of $S^*$. Thus, we obtain a contradiction to our assumption that $S^*$ is a seam of minimum disruptive measure.\n\n\nLet $disr[i, j]$ be the value of the minimum disruptive measure among all seams that start with pixel $A[i, j]$. For row $m$, the seam with the minimum disruptive measure consists of just one point. We can now state a recurrence for $disr[i, j]$  as follows. In the base case, $disr[m, j] = d[m, j]$ for $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. In the recursive case, for $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$,\n\n\n$$disr[i, j] = d[i, j] + \\min_{k \\in K}{dist[i + i, j + k]},$$\n\n\nwhere the set $K$ of index offsets is\n\n\n$$\nK =\n\\begin{cases}\n{0, 1}     & \\text{if $j = 1$}, \\\\\n{-1, 0, 1} & \\text{if $1 < j < m$}, \\\\\n{-1, 0}    & \\text{if $j = n$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nSince every seam has to start with a pixel of the first row, we simply find the minimum $disr[1, j]$ for pixels in the first row to obtain the minimum disruptive measure.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\nCOMPRESS\n-\nIMAGE\n(\nd\n)\n\n    \nm\n \n=\n \nd\n.\nrows\n\n    \nn\n \n=\n \nd\n.\ncolumns\n\n    \nlet\n \ndisr\n[\n1.\n.\nm\n,\n \n1.\n.\nn\n]\n \nand\n \nnext\n[\n1.\n.\nm\n,\n \n1.\n.\nn\n]\n \nbe\n \nnew\n \ntables\n\n    \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \ndisr\n[\nm\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nd\n[\nm\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \nm\n \n-\n \n1\n \ndownto\n \n1\n\n        \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n            \nlow\n \n=\n \nmax\n(\n-\n1\n,\n \n1\n \n-\n \nj\n)\n\n            \nhigh\n \n=\n \nmin\n(\n1\n,\n \nn\n \n-\n \nj\n)\n\n            \ndisr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n            \nfor\n \nk\n \n=\n \nlow\n \nto\n \nhigh\n\n                \nif\n \ndisr\n[\ni\n \n+\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n \n+\n \nk\n]\n \n<\n \ndisr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n                    \ndisr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \ndisr\n[\ni\n \n+\n \n1\n,\n \nj\n \n+\n \nk\n]\n\n                    \nnext\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nj\n \n+\n \nk\n\n            \ndisr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \ndisr\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n+\n \nd\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n    \nval\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n    \nstart\n \n=\n \n1\n\n    \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nif\n \ndisr\n[\n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n<\n \nval\n\n            \nval\n \n=\n \ndisr\n[\n1\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n            \nstart\n \n=\n \nj\n\n    \nprint\n \n\"The minimum value of the disruptive measure is\"\n \nval\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nm\n\n        \nprint\n \n\"cup point at\"\n \n(\ni\n,\n \nstart\n)\n\n        \nstart\n \n=\n \nnext\n[\ni\n,\n \nstart\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe procedure $\\text{COMPRESS-IMAGE}$ is simply an implementation of this recurrence in a bottom-up fashion.\n\n\nWe first carry out the initialization of the base cases, which are the cases when row $i = m$. The minimum disruptive measure for the base cases is simply $d[m, j]$.\n\n\nThe next \nfor\n loop runs down from $m - 1$ to $1$. Thus, $disr[i + 1, j]$ is already available before computing $dist[i, j]$ for pixels of row $i$.\n\n\nThe assignments to $low$ and $high$ allow the index offset $k$ to range over the correct set $K$ from above. We set $low$ to $0$ when $j = 1$ and to $-1$ when $j > 1$, and we set $high$ to $0$ when $j = n$ and to $1$ when $j < n$. The innermost \nfor\n loop sets $dist[i, j]$ to the minimum value of $disr[i + 1, j + k]$ for all $k \\in K$, and the line that follows this loop adds in $d[i, j]$.\n\n\nWe use the $next$ table to reconstruct the actual seam. For a given pixel, it records which pixel was used as the next pixel. Specifically, for a pixel $A[i, j]$, if $next[i, j] = p$, where $p \\in {j - 1, j, j + 1}$, then the next pixel of the seam is $A[i + 1, p]$.\n\n\nThe last line of the \nfor\n loop adds the disruptive measure of the current pixel to the disruptive measure of the seam.\n\n\nThe next \nfor\n loop finds the minimum disruptive measure of pixels in the first row. We print the minimum disruptive measure as the answer.\n\n\nThe rest of the code reconstructs the actual seam, using the information stored in the $next$ array.\n\n\nNoting that the innermost \nfor\n loop runs over at most three values of $k$, we see that the running time of $\\text{COMPRESS-IMAGE}$ is $O(mn)$. The space requirement is also $O(mn)$. We can improve upon the space requirement by observing that row $i$ of the $disr$ table depends on only row $i + 1$. Therefore, we can store just two rows at any time. Thus, we can improve the space requirement of $\\text{COMPRESS-IMAGE}$ to $O(n)$.",

            "text": "A certain string-processing language allows a programmer to break a string into two pieces. Because this operation copies the string, it costs $n$ time units to break a string of $n$ characters into two pieces. Suppose a programmer wants to break a string into many pieces. The order in which the breaks occur can affect the total amount of time used. For example, suppose that the programmer wants to break a $20$-character string after characters $2$, $8$, and $10$ (numbering the characters in ascending order from the left-hand end, starting from $1$). If she programs the breaks to occur in left-to-right order, then the first break costs $20$ time units, the second break costs $18$ time units (breaking the string from characters $3$ to $20$ at character $8$), and the third break costs $12$ time units, totaling $50$ time units. If she programs the breaks to occur in right-to-left order, however, then the first break costs $20$ time units, the second break costs $10$ time units, and the third break costs $8$ time units, totaling $38$ time units. In yet another order, she could break first at $8$ (costing $20$), then break the left piece at $2$ (costing $8$), and finally the right piece at $10$ (costing $12$), for a total cost of $40$.\n\n\nDesign an algorithm that, given the numbers of characters after which to break, determines a least-cost way to sequence those breaks. More formally, given a string $S$ with $n$ characters and an array $L[1..m]$ containing the break points, com- pute the lowest cost for a sequence of breaks, along with a sequence of breaks that achieves this cost.\n\n\n\n\nOur first step will be to identify the subproblems that satisfy the optimalsubstructure property. Before we frame the subproblem, we make two simplifying modifications to the input:\n\n\n\n\nWe sort $L$ so that the indices in $L$ are in ascending order.\n\n\nWe prepend the index $0$ to the beginning of $L$ and append n to the end of $L$.\n\n\n\n\nLet $L[i..j]$ denote a subarray of $L$ that starts from index $i$ and ends at index $j$. Define the subproblem denoted by $(i, j)$ as ''What is the cheapest sequence of breaks to break the substring $S[L[i] + 1..L[j]]$?'' Note that the first and last elements of the subarray $L[i..j]$ define the ends of the substring, and we have to worry about only the indices of the subarray $L[i + 1..j - 1]$.\n\n\nFor example, let $L = \\langle 20, 17, 14, 11, 25 \\rangle$ and $n = 30$. First, we sort $L$. Then, we prepend $0$ and append $n$ as explained to get $L = \\langle 0, 11, 14, 17, 20, 25, 30 \\rangle$. Now, what is the subproblem $(2, 6)$? We obtain a substring by breaking $S$ after character $L[2] = 11$ and character $L[6] = 25$. We ask ''What is the cheapest sequence of breaks to break the substring $S[12..25]$?'' We have to worry about only indices in the subarray $L[3..5] = \\langle 14, 17, 20 \\rangle$, since the other indices are not present in the substring.\n\n\nAt this point, the problem looks similar to matrix-chain multiplication (see Section 15.2). We can make the first break at any element of $L[i + 1..j - 1]$.\n\n\nSuppose that an optimal sequence of breaks $\\sigma$ for subproblem $(i, j)$ makes the first break at $L[k]$, where $i < k < j$. This break gives rise to two subproblems:\n\n\n\n\nThe ''prefix'' subproblem $(i, k)$, covering the subarray $L[i + 1..k - 1]$,\n\n\nThe ''suffix'' subproblem $(k, j)$, covering the subarray $L[k + 1..j - 1]$.\n\n\n\n\nThe overall cost can be expressed as the sum of the length of the substring, the prefix cost, and the suffix cost.\n\n\nWe show optimal substructure by claiming that the sequence of breaks in  for the prefix subproblem $(i, k)$ must be an optimal one. Why? If there were a less costly way to break the substring $S[L[i] + 1..L[k]]$ represented by the subproblem $(i, k)$, then substituting that sequence of breaks in $\\sigma$ would produce another sequence of breaks whose cost is lower than that of $\\sigma$, which would be a contradiction. A similar observation holds for the sequence of breaks for the suffix subproblem $(k, j)$: it must be an optimal sequence of breaks.\n\n\nLet $cost[i, j]$ denote the cost of the cheapest solution to subproblem $(i, j)$. We write the recurrence relation for cost as\n\n\n$$\ncost[i, j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0                                                                 & \\text{if $j - i \\le 1$}, \\\\\n\\min\\limits_{i < k < j} {cost[i, k] + cost[k, j] + (L[j] - L[i])} & \\text{if $j - i > 1$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThus, our approach to solving the subproblem $(i, j)$ will be to try to split the respective substring at all possible values of $k$ and then choosing a break that results in the minimum cost. We need to be careful to solve smaller subproblems before we solve larger subproblems. In particular, we solve subproblems in increasing order of the length $j - 1$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\nBREAK\n-\nSTRING\n(\nn\n,\n \nL\n)\n\n    \nprepend\n \n0\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nstart\n \nof\n \nL\n \nand\n \nappend\n \nn\n \nto\n \nthe\n \nend\n \nof\n \nL\n\n    \nm\n \n=\n \nL\n.\nlength\n\n    \nsort\n \nL\n \ninto\n \nincreasing\n \norder\n\n    \nlet\n \ncost\n[\n1.\n.\nm\n,\n \n1.\n.\nm\n]\n \nand\n \nbreak\n[\n1.\n.\nm\n,\n \n1.\n.\nm\n]\n \nbe\n \nnew\n \ntables\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nm\n \n-\n \n1\n\n        \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \ni\n]\n \n=\n \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \ni\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n    \ncost\n[\nm\n,\n \nm\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n\n    \nfor\n \nlen\n \n=\n \n3\n \nto\n \nm\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nm\n \n-\n \nlen\n \n+\n \n1\n\n            \nj\n \n=\n \ni\n \n+\n \nlen\n \n-\n \n1\n\n            \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n            \nfor\n \nk\n \n=\n \ni\n \n+\n \n1\n \nto\n \nj\n \n-\n \n1\n\n                \nif\n \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nk\n]\n \n+\n \ncost\n[\nk\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n<\n \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n                    \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nk\n]\n \n+\n \ncost\n[\nk\n,\n \nj\n]\n\n                    \nbreak\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \nk\n\n            \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n=\n \ncost\n[\ni\n,\n \nj\n]\n \n+\n \nL\n[\nj\n]\n \n-\n \nL\n[\ni\n]\n\n    \nprint\n \n\"The minimum cost of breaking the string is\"\n \ncost\n[\n1\n,\n \nm\n]\n\n    \nPRINT\n-\nBREAKS\n(\nL\n,\n \nbreak\n,\n \n1\n,\n \nm\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter sorting $L$, we initialize the base cases, in which $i = j$ or $j = i + 1$.\n\n\nThe nested \nfor\n loops represent the main computation. The outermost \nfor\n loop runs for $len = 3$ to $m$, which means that we need to consider subarrays of $L$ with length at least $3$, since the first and the last element define the substring, and we need at least one more element to specify a break. The increasing values of $len$ also ensures that we solve subproblems with smaller length before we solve subproblems with greater length.\n\n\nThe inner \nfor\n loop on $i$ runs from $1$ to $m - len + 1$. The upper bound of $m - len + 1$ is the largest value that the start index $i$ can take such that $i + len - 1 \\le m$.\n\n\nIn the innermost \nfor\n loop, we try each possible location k as the place to make the first break for subproblem $(i, j)$. The first such place is $L[i + 1]$, and not $L[i]$, since $L[i]$ represents the start of the substring (and thus not a valid place for a break). Similarly, the last valid place is $L[j - 1]$, because $L[j]$ represents the end of the substring.\n\n\nThe \nif\n condition tests whether $k$ is the best place for a break found so far, and it updates the best value in $cost[i, j]$ if so. We use $break[i, j]$ to record that the best place for the first break is $k$. Specifically, if $break[i, j] = k$, then an optimal sequence of breaks for $(i, j)$ makes the first break at $L[k]$.\n\n\nFinally, we add the length of the substring $L[j] - L[i]$ to $cost[i, j]$ because, irrespective of what we choose as the first break, it costs us a price equal to the length of the substring to make a break.\n\n\nThe lowest cost for the original problem ends up in $cost[1, m]$. By our initialization, $L[1] = 0$ and $L[m] = n$. Thus, $cost[1, m]$ will hold the optimum price of cutting the substring from $L[1] + 1 = 1$ to $L[m] = n$, which is the entire string.\n\n\nThe running time is $\\Theta(m^3)$, and it is dictated by the three nested \nfor\n loops. They fill in the entries above the main diagonal of the two tables, except for entries in which $j = i + 1$. That is, they fill in rows $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m - 2$, entries $j = i + 2, i + 3, \\ldots, m$. When filling in entry $[i, j]$, we check values of $k$ running from $i + 1$ to $j - 1$, or $j - i - 1$ entries. Thus, the total number of iterations of the innermost \nfor\n loop is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum{i = 1}^{m - 2} \\sum{j = i + 2}^m (j - i - 1) \n    & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{m - 2} \\sum{d = 1}^{m - i - 1} d & \\text{($d = j - i - 1$)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{i = 1}^{m - 2} \\Theta((m - i)^2)         & \\text{(equation (A.2))} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{h = 2}^{m - 1} \\Theta(h^2)               & (h = m - i) \\\\\n    & = \\Theta(m^3).                                   & \\text{(equation (A.3))}\n\\end{align}\n\n\nSince each iteration of the innermost \nfor\n loop takes constant time, the total running time is $\\Theta(m^3)$. Note in particular that the running time is independent of the length of the string $n$.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nPRINT\n-\nBREAKS\n(\nL\n,\n \nbreak\n,\n \ni\n,\n \nj\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nj\n \n-\n \ni\n \n\u2265\n \n2\n\n        \nprint\n \n\"Break at\"\n \nL\n[\nk\n]\n\n        \nPRINT\n-\nBREAKS\n(\nL\n,\n \nbreak\n,\n \ni\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n        \nPRINT\n-\nBREAKS\n(\nL\n,\n \nbreak\n,\n \nk\n,\n \nj\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{PRINT-BREAKS}$ uses the information stored in $break$ to print out the actual sequence of breaks.",

You decide to invest this money with the goal of maximizing your return at the end of 10 years. You decide to use the Amalgamated Investment Company to manage your investments. Amalgamated Investments requires you to observe the following rules. It offers $n$ different investments, numbered $1$ through $n$. In each year $j$, investment $i$ provides a return rate of $r_{ij}$ . In other words, if you invest $d$ dollars in investment $i$ in year $j$, then at the end of year $j$ , you have $dr_{ij}$ dollars. The return rates are guaranteed, that is, you are given all the return rates for the next 10 years for each investment. You make investment decisions only once per year. At the end of each year, you can leave the money made in the previous year in the same investments, or you can shift money to other investments, by either shifting money between existing investments or moving money to a new investement. If you do not move your money between two consecutive years, you pay a fee of $f_1$ dollars, whereas if you switch your money, you pay a fee of $f_2$ dollars, where $f_2 > f_1$.\n\n\na.\n The problem, as stated, allows you to invest your money inmultiple investments in each year. Prove that there exists an optimal investment strategy that, in each year, puts all the money into a single investment. (Recall that an optimal investment strategy maximizes the amount of money after 10 years and is not concerned with any other objectives, such as minimizing risk.)\n\n\nb.\n Prove that the problem of planning your optimal investment strategy exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\nc.\n Design an algorithm that plans your optimal investment strategy. What is the running time of your algorithm?\n\n\nd.\n Suppose that Amalgamated Investments imposed the additional restriction that, at any point, you can have no more than $\\$15,000$ in any one investment. Show that the problem of maximizing your income at the end of 10 years no longer exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Without loss of generality, suppose that there exists an optimal solution $S$ which involves investing $d_1$ dollars into investment $k$ and $d_2$ dollars into investement $m$ in year $1$. Further, suppose in this optimal solution, you don't move your money for the first $j$ years. If $r_{k1} + r_{k2} + \\ldots + r_{kj} > r_{m1} +r_{m2} + \\ldots + r_{mj}$ then we can perform the usual cut-and-paste maneuver and instead invest $d_1 + d_2$ dollars into investment $k$ for $j$ years. Keeping all other investments the same, this results in a strategy which is at least as profitable as $S$, but has reduced the number of different investments in a given span of years by $1$. Continuing in this way, we can reduce the optimal strategy to consist of only a single investment each year.\n\n\nb.\n If a particular investment strategy is the year-one-plan for a optimal investment strategy, then we must solve two kinds of optimal suproblem: either we maintain the strategy for an additional year, not incurring the moneymoving fee, or we move the money, which amounts to solving the problem where we ignore all information from year $1$. Thus, the problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\nc.\n The algorithm works as follows: We build tables $I$ and $R$ of size $10$ such that $I[i]$ tells which investment should be made (with all money) in year $i$, and $R[i]$ gives the total return on the investment strategy in years $i$ through $10$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nINVEST\n(\nd\n,\n \nn\n)\n\n    \ninitialize\n \ntables\n \nI\n \nand\n \nR\n \nof\n \nsize\n \n11\n,\n \nall\n \nfilled\n \nwith\n \n0\ns\n\n    \nfor\n \nk\n \n=\n \n10\n \ndownto\n \n1\n\n        \nq\n \n=\n \n1\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n            \nif\n \nr\n[\ni\n,\n \nk\n]\n \n>\n \nr\n[\nq\n,\n \nk\n]\n   \n// i now holds the investment which looks best for a given year\n\n                \nq\n \n=\n \ni\n\n        \nif\n \nR\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \ndrI\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\nk\n \n-\n \nf\n[\n1\n]\n \n>\n \nR\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n  \ndr\n[\nq\n,\n \nk\n]\n \n-\n \nf\n[\n2\n]\n  \n// If revenue is greater when money is not moved\n\n            \nR\n[\nk\n]\n \n=\n \nR\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \ndrI\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\nk\n \n-\n \nf\n[\n1\n]\n\n            \nI\n[\nk\n]\n \n=\n \nI\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n\n        \nelse\n\n            \nR\n[\nk\n]\n \n=\n \nR\n[\nk\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n+\n \ndr\n[\nq\n,\n \nk\n]\n \n-\n \nf\n[\n2\n]\n\n            \nI\n[\nk\n]\n \n=\n \nq\n\n    \nreturn\n \nI\n \nas\n \nan\n \noptimal\n \nstategy\n \nwith\n \nreturn\n \nR\n[\n1\n].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd.\n The previous investment strategy was independent of the amount of money you started with. When there is a cap on the amount you can invest, the amount you have to invest in the next year becomes relevant. If we know the year-one-strategy of an optimal investment, and we know that we need to move money after the first year, we're left with the problem of investing a different initial amount of money, so we'd have to solve a subproblem for every possible initial amount of money.

The company wishes to design a plan for the next $n$ months. For each month $i$, the company knows the demand $d_i$, that is, the number of machines that it will sell. Let $D = \\sum_{i = 1}^n d_i$ be the total demand over the next $n$ months. The company keeps a full-time staff who provide labor to manufacture up to $m$ machines per month. If the company needs to make more than $m$ machines in a given month, it can hire additional, part-time labor, at a cost that works out to $c$ dollars per machine. Furthermore, if, at the end of a month, the company is holding any unsold machines, it must pay inventory costs. The cost for holding $j$ machines is given as a function $h(j)$ for $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, D$, where $h(j) \\ge 0$ for $1 \\le j \\le D$ and $h(j) \\le h(j + 1)$ for $1 \\le j \\le D - 1$. \n\n\nGive an algorithm that calculates a plan for the company that minimizes its costs while fulfilling all the demand. The running time should be polyomial in $n$ and $D$.\n\n\n\n\nWe state the subproblem $(k, s)$ as ''What is the cheapest way to satisfy all the demands of months $k, \\ldots, n$ when we start with a surplus of s before the $k$th month?'' A plan for the subproblem $(k, s)$ would specify the number of machines to manufacture for each month $k, \\ldots, n$ such that demands are satisfied.\n\n\nIn some optimal plan $P$ to $(k, s)$, let $f^*$  machines be maufactured in month $k$. Thus, the surplus $s'$ in month $k + 1$ is $s + f^* - d_k$. Let $P'$ be the part of the plan $P$ for months $k + 1, \\ldots, n$. We claim that $P'$ is an optimal plan for the subproblem $(k + 1, s')$. Why? Suppose $P'$ were not an optimal plan and let $P''$ be an optimal plan for $(k + 1, s')$. If we modify plan $P$ by cutting out $P'$ and pasting in $P''$ (i.e., by using plan $P''$ for months $k + 1, \\ldots, n$), we obtain another plan for $(k, s)$ which is cheaper than plan $P$ . Thus, we obtain a contradiction to the assumption that plan $P$ was optimal.\n\n\nLet $cost[k, s]$ denote the cost of an optimal plan for $(k, s)$, and let $f$ denote the number of machines that can be manufactured in month $k$. The bounds for $f$ are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least the number of machines so that (along with surplus $s$) there are enough machines to satisfy the current month's demand. Let us denote this lower bound by $L(k, s)$. We have\n\n\n$$\nL(k, s) = \\max(d_k - s, 0).\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt most the number of machines such that there are enough machines to satisfy the demands of all the following months. Let us denote this upper bound by $U(k, s)$. We have\n\n\n$$\nU(k, s) = \\Bigg(\\sum_{i = k}^n d_i \\Bigg) - s.\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the last month, we need only manufacture the minimum required number of machines, given by $L(n, s)$. For other months, we examine the costs of manufacturing all feasible numbers of machines and see which choice gives us the cheapest plan. We can now write the recurrence for cost as the following:\n\n\n$$\ncost[k, s] =\n\\begin{cases}\nc \\cdot \\max(L(n, s) - m, 0) + h(s + L(n, s) - d_n) & \\text{if $k = n$}, \\\\\n\\min\\limits_{L(k, s) \\le f \\le U(k, s)} \\Big\\{cost[k + 1, s + f - d_k] + c \\cdot \\max(f - m, 0) + h(s + f - d_k)\\Big\\} & \\text{if $0 < k < n$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThe recurrence suggests how to build an optimal plan in a bottom-up fashion.

First, we solve the subproblem for the last month, for all surpluses. Then, for each month and for each surplus entering that month, we calculate the cheapest way to satisfy demand for that month based on the solved subproblems of the next month.\n\n\n\n\n$f$ is the number of machines that we try to manufacture in month $k$.\n\n\n$cost[k, s]$ holds the cheapest way to satisfy demands of months $k, \\ldots, n$, with a net surplus of s left over at the beginning of month $k$.\n\n\n$make[k, s]$ holds the number of machines to manufacture in month $k$ and the surplus $s$ of an optimal plan. We will use this table to reconstruct the optimal plan.\n\n\n\n\nWe first initialize the base cases, which are the cases for month $n$ starting with surplus $s$, for $s = 0, \\ldots, D$. If $d_n > s$, it suffices to manufacture $d_n - s$ machines, since we need not keep any surplus after month $n$. If $d_n \\le s$, we need not manufacture any machines at all.\n\n\nWe then calculate the total cost for month $n$ as the sum of hiring extra labor $c \\cdot \\max(f - m, 0)$ and the inventory costs for leftover surplus $h(s + f - d_n)$, which can be nonzero if we had started out with a large surplus.\n\n\nThe outer \nfor\n loop of the next block of code runs down from month $n - 1$ to $1$, thus ensuring that when we consider month $k$, we have already solved the subproblems of month $k + 1$.\n\n\nThe next inner \nfor\n loop iterates through all possible values of $f$ as described.\n\n\nFor every choice of $f$ for a given month $k$, the total cost of $(k, s)$ is given by the cost of extra labor (if any) plus the cost of inventory (if there is a surplus) plus the cost of the subproblem $(k + 1, s + f - d_k)$. This value is checked and updated. Finally, the required answer is the answer to the subproblem $(1, 0)$, which appears in $cost[1, 0]$. That is, it is the cheapest way to satisfy all the demands of months $1, \\ldots, n$ when we start with a surplus of $0$.\n\n\nThe running time of $\\text{INVENTORY-PLANNING}$ is clearly $O(nD^2)$. The space requirement is $O(nD)$. We can improve upon the space requirement by noting that we need only store the solution to subproblems of the next month. With this observation, we can construct an algorithm that uses $O(n + D)$ space.",

            "text": "Suppose that you are the general manager for a major-league baseball team. During the off-season, you need to sign some free-agent players for your team. The team owner has given you a budget of $\\$X$ to spend on free agents. You are allowed to spend less than $\\$X$ altogether, but the owner will fire you if you spend any more than $\\$X$.\n\n\nYou are considering $N$ different positions, and for each position, $P$ free-agent players who play that position are available. Because you do not want to overload your roster with too many players at any position, for each position you may sign at most one free agent who plays that position. (If you do not sign any players at a particular position, then you plan to stick with the players you already have at that position.)\n\n\nTo determine how valuable a player is going to be, you decide to use a sabermetric statistic known as ''$\\text{VORP}$'', or ''value over replacement player''. A player with a higher $\\text{VORP}$ is more valuable than a player with a lower $\\text{VORP}$. A player with a higher $\\text{VORP}$ is not necessarily more expensive to sign than a player with a lower $\\text{VORP}$, because factors other than a player's value determine how much it costs to sign him.\n\n\nFor each available free-agent player, you have three pieces of information:\n\n\n\n\nthe player's position,\n\n\nthe amount of money it will cost to sign the player, and\n\n\nthe player's $\\text{VORP}$.\n\n\n\n\nDevise an algorithm that maximizes the total $\\text{VORP}$ of the players you sign while spending no more than $\\$X$ altogether. You may assume that each player signs for a multiple of $100,000$. Your algorithm should output the total $\\text{VORP}$ of the players you sign, the total amount of money you spend, and a list of which players you sign. Analyze the running time and space requirement of your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nLet $p.cost$ denote the cost and $p.vorp$ denote the $\\text{VORP}$ of player $p$. We shall assume that all dollar amounts are expressed in units of $\\$100,000$.\n\n\nSince the order of choosing players for the positions does not matter, we may assume that we make our decisions starting from position $1$, moving toward position $N$. For each position, we decide to either sign one player or sign no players. Suppose we decide to sign player $p$, who plays position $1$. Then, we are left with an amount of $X - p.cost$ dollars to sign players at positions $2, \\ldots, N$. This observation guides us in how to frame the subproblems.\n\n\nWe define the cost and $\\text{VORP}$ of a \nset\n of players as the sum of costs and the sum of $\\text{VORP}$s of all players in that set. Let ($(i, x)$ denote the following subproblem: ''Suppose we consider only positions $i, i + 1, \\ldots, N$ and we can spend at most $x$ dollars. What set of players (with at most one player for each position under consideration) has the maximum $\\text{VORP}$?'' A \nvalid\n set of players for ($(i, x)$ is one in which each player in the set plays one of the positions $i, i + 1, \\ldots, n$, each position has at most one player, and the cost of the players in the set is at most $x$ dollars. An \noptimal\n set of players for ($(i, x)$ is a valid set with the maximum $\\text{VORP}$. We now show that the problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\nTheorem (Optimal substructure of the VORP maximization problem)\n\n\nLet $L = \\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_k\\}$ be a set of players, possibly empty, with maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for the subproblem $(i, x)$.\n\n\n\n\nIf $i = N$, then $L$ has at most one player. If all players in position $N$ have cost more than $x$, then $L$ has no players. Otherwise, $L = \\{p_1\\}$, where $p_1$ has the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ among players for position $N$ with cost at most $x$.\n\n\nIf $i < N$ and $L$ includes player $p$ for position i, then $L' = L - \\{p\\}$ is an optimal set for the subproblem $(i + 1, x - p.cost)$.\n\n\nIf $i < N$ and $L$ does not include a player for position $i$, then $L$ is an optimal set for the subproblem $(i + 1, x)$.\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\nProperty 1. follows trivially from the problem statement.\n\n2. Suppose that $L'$ is not an optimal set for the subproblem $(i + 1, x - p.cost)$. Then, there exists another valid set $L''$ for $(i + 1, x - p.cost)$ that has $\\text{VORP}$ more than $L'$. Let $L^{\\prime\\prime\\prime} = L'' \\cup \\{p\\}$. The cost of $L^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ is at most $x$, since $L''$ has a cost at most $x - p.cost$. Moreover, $L^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ has at most one player for each position $i, i + 1, \\ldots, N$. Thus, $L^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ is a valid set for $(i, x)$. But $L^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}$ has $\\text{VORP}$ more than $L$, thus contradicting the assumption that $L$ had the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for $(i, x)$.\n3. Clearly, any valid set for $(i + 1, x)$ is also a valid set for $(i, x)$. If $L$ were not an optimal set for $(i + 1, x)$, then there exists another valid set $L'$ for $(i + 1, x)$ with $\\text{VORP}$ more than $L$. The set $L'$ would also be a valid set for $(i, x)$, which contradicts the assumption that $L$ had the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for $(i, x)$.\n\n\nThe theorem suggests that when $i < N$, we examine two subproblems and choose the better of the two. Let $v[i, x]$ denote the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for $(i, x)$. Let $S(i, x)$ be the set of players who play position $i$ and cost at most $x$. In the following recurrence for $v[i, x]$ we assume that the max function returns $-\\infty$ when invoked over an empty set:\n\n\n$$\nv[i, x] =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\max\\limits_{p \\in S(N, x)} {p.vorp} & \\text{if $i = N$}, \\\\\n\\max \\Big\\{v[i + 1, x], \\max\\limits_{p \\in S(i, x)}{p.vorp + v[i + 1, x - p.cost]} \\Big\\} & \\text{if $i < N$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThis recurrence lends itself to implementation in a straightforward way.

The table $v[i, x]$ holds the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for the subproblem $(i, x)$. The table $who[i, x]$ holds information necessary to reconstruct the actual solution. Specifically, $who[i, x]$ holds the index of player to sign for position $i$, or $0$ if no player should be signed for position $i$. The first set of nested \nfor\n loops initializes the base cases, in which $i = N$. For every amount $x$, the inner loop simply picks the player with the highest $\\text{VORP}$ who plays position $N$ and whose cost is at most $x$.\n\n\nThe next set of three nested \nfor\n loops represents the main computation. The outermost \nfor\n loop runs down from position $N - 1$ to $1$. This order ensures that smaller subproblems are solved before larger ones. We initialize $v[i, x]$ as $v[i + 1, x]$. This way, we already take care of the case in which we decide not to sign any player who plays position $i$. The innermost \nfor\n loop tries to sign each player (if we have enough money) in turn, and it keeps track of the maximum $\\text{VORP}$ possible.\n\n\nThe maximum $\\text{VORP}$ for the entire problem ends up in $v[1, X]$. The final \nfor\n loop uses the information in who table to print out which players to sign. The running time of $\\text{FREE-AGENT-VORP}$ is clearly $\\Theta(NPX)$, and it uses $\\Theta(NX)$ space.",

Compare the running time of your solution to the running time of $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$.\n\n\n\n\nThe tricky part is determining which activities are in the set $S_{ij}$. If activity $k$ is in $S_{ij}$, then we must have $i < k < j$, which means that $j - 1 \\ge 2$, but we must also have that $f_i \\le s_k$ and $f_k \\le s_j$. If we start $k$ at $j - 1$ and decrement $k$, we can stop once $k$ reaches $i$, but we can also stop once we find that $f_k \\le f_i$, since then activities $i + 1$ through $k$ cannot be compatible with activity $i$.\n\n\nWe create two fictitious activities, $a_0$ with $f_0 = 0$ and $a_{n + 1}$ with $s_{n + 1} = \\infty$. We are interested in a maximum-size set $A_{0, n + 1}$ of mutually compatible activities in $S_{0, n + 1}$.

The recursion bottoms out when $c[i, j] = 0$, so that $A_{ij} = \\emptyset$.\n\n\nWhereas $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ runs in $\\Theta(n)$ time, the $\\text{DYNAMIC-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ procedure runs in $O(n^3)$ time.\n\n\n16.1-2\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that instead of always selecting the first activity to finish, we instead select the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activities. Describe how this approach is a greedy algorithm, and prove that it yields an optimal solution.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed approach\u2014selecting the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activities\u2014is really the greedy algorithm but starting from the end rather than the beginning.\n\n\nAnother way to look at it is as follows. We are given a set $S = \\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\}$ of activities, where $a_i = [s_i, f_i)$, and we propose to find an optimal solution by selecting the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activities. Instead, let us create a set $S = \\{a_1', a_2', \\ldots, a_n'\\}$, where $a_i' = [f_i, s_i)$. That is, $a_i'$ is $a_i$ in reverse. Clearly, a subset of $\\{a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \\ldots, a_{i_k}\\} \\subseteq S$ is mutually compatible if and only if the corresponding subset $\\{a_{i_1}', a_{i_2}', \\ldots, a_{i_k}'\\} \\subseteq S'$  is also mutually compatible. Thus, an optimal solution for $S$ maps directly to an optimal solution for $S'$ and vice versa.\n\n\nThe proposed approach of selecting the last activity to start that is compatible with all previously selected activities, when run on $S$, gives the same answer as the greedy algorithm from the text\u2014selecting the first activity to finish that is compatible with all previously selected activities\u2014when run on $S'$. The solution that the proposed approach finds for $S$ corresponds to the solution that the text's greedy algorithm finds for $S'$, and so it is optimal.\n\n\n16.1-3\n\n\n\n\nNot just any greedy approach to the activity-selection problem produces a maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities. Give an example to show that the approach of selecting the activity of least duration from among those that are compatible with previously selected activities does not work. Do the same for the approaches of always selecting the compatible activity that overlaps the fewest other remaining activities and always selecting the compatible remaining activity with the earliest start time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the approach of selecting the activity of least duration from those that are compatible with previously selected activities:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{l|ccc}\n  i             & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\ns_i             & 0 & 2 & 3 \\\\\nf_i             & 3 & 4 & 6 \\\\\n\\text{duration} & 3 & 2 & 3\n\\end{array}\n\n\nThis approach selects just $\\{a_2\\}$, but the optimal solution selects $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the approach of always selecting the compatible activity that overlaps the fewest other remaining activities:\n\n\n\\begin{array}{l|ccc}\n  i             & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\\\\n\\hline\ns_i             & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 5 &  5 &  6 \\\\\nf_i             & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 7 &  7 &  8 \\\\\n\\text{# of overlapping activities} & 3 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 4 &  4 &  3\n\\end{array}\n\n\nThis approach frst selects $a_6$, and after that choice it can select only two other activities (one of $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $a_4$ and one of $a_8$, $a_9$, $a_{10}$, $a_{11}$). An optimal solution is $\\{a_1, a_5, a_7, a_{11}\\}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the approach of always selecting the compatible remaining activity with the earliest start time, just add one more activity with the interval $[0, 14)$ to the example in Section 16.1. It will be the first activity selected, and no other activities are compatible with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1-4\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we have a set of activities to schedule among a large number of lecture halls, where any activity can take place in any lecture hall. We wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an efficient greedy algorithm to determine which activity should use which lecture hall.\n\n\n(This problem is also known as the \ninterval-graph coloring problem\n. We can create an interval graph whose vertices are the given activities and whose edges connect incompatible activities. The smallest number of colors required to color every vertex so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color corresponds to finding the fewest lecture halls needed to schedule all of the given activities.)\n\n\n\n\nLet $S$ be the set of $n$ activities.\n\n\nThe ''obvious'' solution of using $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ to find a maximum-size set $S_1$ of compatible activities from $S$ for the first lecture hall, then using it again to find a maximum-size set $S_2$ of compatible activities from $S - S_1$ for the second hall, (and so on until all the activities are assigned), requires $\\Theta(n^2)$ time in the worst case.\n\n\nThere is a better algorithm, however, whose asymptotic time is just the time needed to sort the activities by time\u2014$O(n\\lg n)$ time for arbitrary times, or possibly as fast as $O(n)$ if the times are small integers.\n\n\nThe general idea is to go through the activities in order of start time, assigning each to any hall that is available at that time. To do this, move through the set of events consisting of activities starting and activities finishing, in order of event time. Maintain two lists of lecture halls: Halls that are busy at the current event time $t$ (because they have been assigned an activity $i$ that started at $s_i \\le t$ but won't finish until $f_i > t$) and halls that are free at time $t$. (As in the activity- selection problem in Section 16.1, we are assuming that activity time intervals are half open\u2014i.e., that if $s_i \\ge f_j$, then activities $i$ and $j$ are compatible.) When $t$ is the start time of some activity, assign that activity to a free hall and move the hall from the free list to the busy list. When $t$ is the finish time of some activity, move the activity's hall from the busy list to the free list. (The activity is certainly in some hall, because the event times are processed in order and the activity must have started before its finish time $t$, hence must have been assigned to a hall.)\n\n\nTo avoid using more halls than necessary, always pick a hall that has already had an activity assigned to it, if possible, before picking a never-used hall. (This can be done by always working at the front of the free-halls list\u2014putting freed halls onto the front of the list and taking halls from the front of the list\u2014so that a new hall doesn't come to the front and get chosen if there are previously-used halls.)\n\n\nThis guarantees that the algorithm uses as few lecture halls as possible: The algorithm will terminate with a schedule requiring $m \\le n$ lecture halls. Let activity $i$ be the first activity scheduled in lecture hall $m$. The reason that $i$ was put in the $m$th lecture hall is that the first $m - 1$ lecture halls were busy at time $s_i$ . So at this time there are $m$ activities occurring simultaneously. Therefore any schedule must use at least $m$ lecture halls, so the schedule returned by the algorithm is optimal.\n\n\nRun time:\n\n\n\n\nSort the $2n$ activity-starts/activity-ends events. (In the sorted order, an activity-ending event should precede an activity-starting event that is at the same time.) $O(n\\lg n)$ time for arbitrary times, possibly $O(n)$ if the times are restricted (e.g., to small integers).\n\n\nProcess the events in $O(n)$ time: Scan the $2n$ events, doing $O(1)$ work for each (moving a hall from one list to the other and possibly associating an activity with it).\n\n\n\n\nTotal: $O(n + \\text{time to sort)}$\n\n[The idea of this algorithm is related to the rectangle-overlap algorithm in Exercise 14.3-7.]\n\n\n16.1-5\n\n\n\n\nConsider a modification to the activity-selection problem in which each activity $a_i$ has, in addition to a start and finish time, a value $v_i$. The objective is no longer to maximize the number of activities scheduled, but instead to maximize the total value of the activities scheduled. That is, we wish to choose a set $A$ of compatible activities such that $\\sum_{a_k \\in A} v_k$ is maximized. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.\n\n\n\n\nWe can no longer use the greedy algorithm to solve this problem. However, as we show, the problem still has an optimal substructure which allows us to formulate a dynamic programming solution. The analysis here follows closely the analysis of Section 16.1 in the book. We define the value of a set of compatible events as the sum of values of events in that set. Let $S_{ij}$ be defined as in Section 16.1. An \noptimal solution\n to $S_{ij}$ is a subset of mutually compatible events of $S_{ij}$ that has maximum value. Let $A_{ij}$ be an optimal solution to $S_{ij}$. Suppose $A_{ij}$ includes an event $a_k$. Let $A_{ik}$ and $A_{kj}$ be defined as in Section 16.1. Thus, we have $A_{ij} = A_{ik} \\cup {a_k} \\cup A_{kj}$, and so the value of maximum-value set $A_{ij}$ is equal to the value of $A_{ik}$ plus the value of $A_{kj}$ plus $v_k$.\n\n\nThe usual cut-and-paste argument shows that the optimal solution $A_{ij}$ must also include optimal solutions to the two subproblems for $S_{ik}$ and $S_{kj}$. If we could find a set $A_{kj}'$ of mutually compatible activities in $S_{kj}$ where the value of $A_{kj}'$ is greater than the value of $A_{kj}$, then we could use $A_{kj}'$, rather than $A_{kj}$, in a solution to the subproblem for $S_{ij}$. We would have constructed a set of mutually compatible activities with greater value than that of $A_{ij}$, which contradicts the assumption that $A_{ij}$ is an optimal solution. A symmetric argument applies to the activities in $S_{ik}$.\n\n\nLet us denote the value of an optimal solution for the set $S_{ij}$ by $val[i, j]$. Then, we would have the recurrence\n\n\n$$val[i, j] = val[i, k] + val[k, j] + v_k.$$\n\n\nOf course, since we do not know that an optimal solution for the set $S_{ij}$ includes activity $a_k$ , we would have to examine all activities in $S_{ij}$ to find which one to choose, so that\n\n\n$$\nval[i, j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if $S_{ij} = \\emptyset$}, \\\\\n\\max\\limits_{a_k\\in S_{ij}} {val[i, k] + val[k, j] + v_k} & \\text{if $S_{ij} \\ne \\emptyset$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nWhile implementing the recurrence, the tricky part is determining which activities are in the set $S_{ij}$ . If activity $k$ is in $S_{ij}$ , then we must have $i < k < j$, which means that $j - i \\ge 2$, but we must also have that $f_i \\le s_k$ and $f_k \\le s_j$. If we start $k$ at $j - 1$ and decrement $k$, we can stop once $k$ reaches $i$, but we can also stop once we find that $f_k \\le f_i$, since then activities $i + 1$ through $k$ cannot be compatible with activity $i$.\n\n\nWe create two fictitious activities, $a_0$ with $f_0 = 0$ and $a_{n + 1}$ with $s_{n + 1} = \\infty$. We are interested in a maximum-size set $A_{0, n + 1}$ of mutually compatible activities in $S_{0, n + 1}$. We'll use tables $val[0..n + 1, 0..n + 1]$, as in the recurrence, and $act[0..n + 1, 0..n + 1]$, where $act[i, j]$ is the activity $k$ that we choose to put into $A_{ij}$ .\n\n\nWe fill the tables in according to increasing difference $j - i$, which we denote by $l$ in the pseudocode. Since $S_{ij} = \\emptyset$ if $j - i < 2$, we initialize $val[i, i] = 0$ for all $i$ and $val[i, i + 1] = 0$ for $0\\le i\\le n$. As in $\\text{RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ and $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$, the start and finish times are given as arrays $s$ and $f$, where we assume that the arrays already include the two fictitious activities and that the activities are sorted by monotonically increasing finish time.

            "text": "Suppose that we have a set of activities to schedule among a large number of lecture halls, where any activity can take place in any lecture hall. We wish to schedule all the activities using as few lecture halls as possible. Give an efficient greedy algorithm to determine which activity should use which lecture hall.  (This problem is also known as the  interval-graph coloring problem . We can create an interval graph whose vertices are the given activities and whose edges connect incompatible activities. The smallest number of colors required to color every vertex so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color corresponds to finding the fewest lecture halls needed to schedule all of the given activities.)   Let $S$ be the set of $n$ activities.  The ''obvious'' solution of using $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ to find a maximum-size set $S_1$ of compatible activities from $S$ for the first lecture hall, then using it again to find a maximum-size set $S_2$ of compatible activities from $S - S_1$ for the second hall, (and so on until all the activities are assigned), requires $\\Theta(n^2)$ time in the worst case.  There is a better algorithm, however, whose asymptotic time is just the time needed to sort the activities by time\u2014$O(n\\lg n)$ time for arbitrary times, or possibly as fast as $O(n)$ if the times are small integers.  The general idea is to go through the activities in order of start time, assigning each to any hall that is available at that time. To do this, move through the set of events consisting of activities starting and activities finishing, in order of event time. Maintain two lists of lecture halls: Halls that are busy at the current event time $t$ (because they have been assigned an activity $i$ that started at $s_i \\le t$ but won't finish until $f_i > t$) and halls that are free at time $t$. (As in the activity- selection problem in Section 16.1, we are assuming that activity time intervals are half open\u2014i.e., that if $s_i \\ge f_j$, then activities $i$ and $j$ are compatible.) When $t$ is the start time of some activity, assign that activity to a free hall and move the hall from the free list to the busy list. When $t$ is the finish time of some activity, move the activity's hall from the busy list to the free list. (The activity is certainly in some hall, because the event times are processed in order and the activity must have started before its finish time $t$, hence must have been assigned to a hall.)  To avoid using more halls than necessary, always pick a hall that has already had an activity assigned to it, if possible, before picking a never-used hall. (This can be done by always working at the front of the free-halls list\u2014putting freed halls onto the front of the list and taking halls from the front of the list\u2014so that a new hall doesn't come to the front and get chosen if there are previously-used halls.)  This guarantees that the algorithm uses as few lecture halls as possible: The algorithm will terminate with a schedule requiring $m \\le n$ lecture halls. Let activity $i$ be the first activity scheduled in lecture hall $m$. The reason that $i$ was put in the $m$th lecture hall is that the first $m - 1$ lecture halls were busy at time $s_i$ . So at this time there are $m$ activities occurring simultaneously. Therefore any schedule must use at least $m$ lecture halls, so the schedule returned by the algorithm is optimal.  Run time:   Sort the $2n$ activity-starts/activity-ends events. (In the sorted order, an activity-ending event should precede an activity-starting event that is at the same time.) $O(n\\lg n)$ time for arbitrary times, possibly $O(n)$ if the times are restricted (e.g., to small integers).  Process the events in $O(n)$ time: Scan the $2n$ events, doing $O(1)$ work for each (moving a hall from one list to the other and possibly associating an activity with it).

            "text": "Consider a modification to the activity-selection problem in which each activity $a_i$ has, in addition to a start and finish time, a value $v_i$. The objective is no longer to maximize the number of activities scheduled, but instead to maximize the total value of the activities scheduled. That is, we wish to choose a set $A$ of compatible activities such that $\\sum_{a_k \\in A} v_k$ is maximized. Give a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.   We can no longer use the greedy algorithm to solve this problem. However, as we show, the problem still has an optimal substructure which allows us to formulate a dynamic programming solution. The analysis here follows closely the analysis of Section 16.1 in the book. We define the value of a set of compatible events as the sum of values of events in that set. Let $S_{ij}$ be defined as in Section 16.1. An  optimal solution  to $S_{ij}$ is a subset of mutually compatible events of $S_{ij}$ that has maximum value. Let $A_{ij}$ be an optimal solution to $S_{ij}$. Suppose $A_{ij}$ includes an event $a_k$. Let $A_{ik}$ and $A_{kj}$ be defined as in Section 16.1. Thus, we have $A_{ij} = A_{ik} \\cup {a_k} \\cup A_{kj}$, and so the value of maximum-value set $A_{ij}$ is equal to the value of $A_{ik}$ plus the value of $A_{kj}$ plus $v_k$.  The usual cut-and-paste argument shows that the optimal solution $A_{ij}$ must also include optimal solutions to the two subproblems for $S_{ik}$ and $S_{kj}$. If we could find a set $A_{kj}'$ of mutually compatible activities in $S_{kj}$ where the value of $A_{kj}'$ is greater than the value of $A_{kj}$, then we could use $A_{kj}'$, rather than $A_{kj}$, in a solution to the subproblem for $S_{ij}$. We would have constructed a set of mutually compatible activities with greater value than that of $A_{ij}$, which contradicts the assumption that $A_{ij}$ is an optimal solution. A symmetric argument applies to the activities in $S_{ik}$.  Let us denote the value of an optimal solution for the set $S_{ij}$ by $val[i, j]$. Then, we would have the recurrence  $$val[i, j] = val[i, k] + val[k, j] + v_k.$$  Of course, since we do not know that an optimal solution for the set $S_{ij}$ includes activity $a_k$ , we would have to examine all activities in $S_{ij}$ to find which one to choose, so that  $$\nval[i, j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if $S_{ij} = \\emptyset$}, \\\\\n\\max\\limits_{a_k\\in S_{ij}} {val[i, k] + val[k, j] + v_k} & \\text{if $S_{ij} \\ne \\emptyset$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$  While implementing the recurrence, the tricky part is determining which activities are in the set $S_{ij}$ . If activity $k$ is in $S_{ij}$ , then we must have $i < k < j$, which means that $j - i \\ge 2$, but we must also have that $f_i \\le s_k$ and $f_k \\le s_j$. If we start $k$ at $j - 1$ and decrement $k$, we can stop once $k$ reaches $i$, but we can also stop once we find that $f_k \\le f_i$, since then activities $i + 1$ through $k$ cannot be compatible with activity $i$.  We create two fictitious activities, $a_0$ with $f_0 = 0$ and $a_{n + 1}$ with $s_{n + 1} = \\infty$. We are interested in a maximum-size set $A_{0, n + 1}$ of mutually compatible activities in $S_{0, n + 1}$. We'll use tables $val[0..n + 1, 0..n + 1]$, as in the recurrence, and $act[0..n + 1, 0..n + 1]$, where $act[i, j]$ is the activity $k$ that we choose to put into $A_{ij}$ .  We fill the tables in according to increasing difference $j - i$, which we denote by $l$ in the pseudocode. Since $S_{ij} = \\emptyset$ if $j - i < 2$, we initialize $val[i, i] = 0$ for all $i$ and $val[i, i + 1] = 0$ for $0\\le i\\le n$. As in $\\text{RECURSIVE-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$ and $\\text{GREEDY-ACTIVITY-SELECTOR}$, the start and finish times are given as arrays $s$ and $f$, where we assume that the arrays already include the two fictitious activities and that the activities are sorted by monotonically increasing finish time.

By decreasing $s_i$ to $\\max(0, W - w_n)$ and increasing $s_n$ by the same amount, we get a better solution. Since this a contradiction the assumption must be false. Hence the problem has the greedy-choice property.\n\n\n16.2-2\n\n\n\n\nGive a dynamic-programming solution to the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem that runs in $O(nW)$ time, where $n$ is the number of items and $W$ is the maximum weight of items that the thief can put in his knapsack.\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is based on the optimal-substructure observation in the text: Let $i$ be the highest-numbered item in an optimal solution $S$ for $W$ pounds and items $1, \\ldots, n$. Then $S'  = S - \\{i\\}$ must be an optimal solution for $W - w_i$ pounds and items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$, and the value of the solution $S$ is $v_i$ plus the value of the subproblem solution $S'$.\n\n\nWe can express this relationship in the following formula: Define $c[i, w]$ to be the value of the solution for items $1, \\ldots, i$ and maximum weight $w$. Then\n\n\n$$\nc[i,w] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0                                          & \\text{ if } i = 0 \\text{ or } w = 0, \\\\\nc[i - 1, w]                                & \\text{ if } w_i > w, \\\\\n\\max(v_i + c[i - 1, w - w_i], c[i - 1, w]) & \\text{ if } i > 0 \\text{ and } w \\ge w_i.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThe last case says that the value of a solution for i items either includes item $i$, in which case it is $v_i$ plus a subproblem solution for $i - 1$ items and the weight excluding $w_i$, or doesn't include item $i$, in which case it is a subproblem solution for $i - 1$ items and the same weight. That is, if the thief picks item $i$, he takes $v_i$ value, and he can choose from items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$ up to the weight limit $w - w_i$ , and get $c[i - 1, w - w_i]$ additional value. On the other hand, if he decides not to take item $i$, he can choose from items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$ up to the weight limit $w$, and get $c[i - 1, w]$ value. The better of these two choices should be made.\n\n\nThe algorithm takes as inputs the maximum weight $W$, the number of items $n$, and the two sequences $v = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\rangle$ and $w = \\langle w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n \\rangle$.

Therefore we should always choose the items with the greatest values.\n\n\n16.2-4\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gekko has always dreamed of inline skating across North Dakota. He plans to cross the state on highway U.S. 2, which runs from Grand Forks, on the eastern border with Minnesota, to Williston, near the western border with Montana. The professor can carry two liters of water, and he can skate $m$ miles before running out of water. (Because North Dakota is relatively flat, the professor does not have to worry about drinking water at a greater rate on uphill sections than on flat or downhill sections.) The professor will start in Grand Forks with two full liters of water. His official North Dakota state map shows all the places along U.S. 2 at which he can refill his water and the distances between these locations.\n\n\nThe professor's goal is to minimize the number of water stops along his route across the state. Give an efficient method by which he can determine which water stops he should make. Prove that your strategy yields an optimal solution, and give its running time.\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal strategy is the obvious greedy one. Starting will both bottles, Professor Gekko should go to the westernmost place that he can refill his bottles within $m$ miles of Grand Forks. Fill up there. Then go to the westernmost refilling location he can get to within $m$ miles of where he filled up, and fill up there, and so on.\n\n\nLooked at another way, at each refilling location, Professor Gekko should check whether he can make it to the next refilling location without stopping at this one. If he can, skip this one. If he cannot, then fill up. Professor Gekko doesn't need to know how much water he has or how fat the next refilling location is to implement this approach, since at each fillup, he can determine which is the next location at which he'll need to stop.\n\n\nThis problem has optimal substructure. Suppose there are $n$ possible refilling locations. Consider an optimal solution with $s$ refilling locations and whose first stop is at the $k$th refilling location. Then the rest of the optimal solution must be an optimal solution to the subproblem of the remaining $n - k$ locations. Otherwise, if there were a better solution to the subproblem, i.e., one with fewer than $s - 1$ stops, we could use it to come up with a solution with fewer than $s$ stops for the full problem, contradicting our supposition of optimality.\n\n\nThis problem also has the greedy-choice property. Suppose there are $k$ refilling locations beyond the start that are within $m$ miles of the start. The greedy solution chooses the $k$th location as its first stop. No location beyond the $k$th works as a first stop, since Professor Gekko runs out of gas first. If a solution chooses a location $j < k$ as its first stop, then Professor Gekko could choose the $k$th location instead, having at least as much water when he leaves the $k$th location as if he'd chosen the $j$th location. Therefore, he would get at least as far without filling up again if he had chosen the $k$th location.\n\n\nIf there are $n$ refilling locations on the map, Professor Gekko needs to inspect each one just once. The running time is $O(n)$.\n\n\n16.2-5\n\n\n\n\nDescribe an efficient algorithm that, given a set $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ of points on the real line, determines the smallest set of unit-length closed intervals that contains all of the given points. Argue that your algorithm is correct.\n\n\n\n\nConsider the leftmost interval. It will do no good if it extends any further left than the leftmost point, however, we know that it must contain the leftmost point. So, we know that it's left hand side is exactly the leftmost point. \n\n\nSo, we just remove any point that is within a unit distance of the left most point since they are contained in this single interval. Then, we just repeat until all points are covered. Since at each step there is a clearly optimal choice for where to put the leftmost interval, this final solution is optimal.\n\n\n16.2-6 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nShow how to solve the fractional knapsack problem in $O(n)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nUse a linear-time median algorithm to calculate the median m of the $v_i / w_i$ ratios. Next, partition the items into three sets: $G = \\{i : v_i / w_i > m\\}$, $E = \\{i : v_i / w_i = m\\}$, and $L = \\{i : v_i / w_i < m\\}$; this step takes linear time. Compute $W_G = \\sum_{i \\in G} w_i$ and $W_E = \\sum_{i \\in E} w_i$, the total weight of the items in sets $G$ and $E$, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nIf $W_G > W$, then do not yet take any items in set $G$, and instead recurse on the set of items $G$ and knapsack capacity $W$.\n\n\nOtherwise $(W_G \\le W)$, take all items in set $G$, and take as much of the items in set $E$ as will fit in the remaining capacity $W - W_G$.\n\n\nIf $W_G + W_E \\ge W$ (i.e., there is no capacity left after taking all the items in set $G$ and all the items in set E that fit in the remaining capacity $W - W_G$), then we are done.\n\n\nOtherwise $(W_G + W_E < W)$, then after taking all the items in sets $G$ and $E$, recurse on the set of items $L$ and knapsack capacity $W - W_G - W_E$.\n\n\n\n\nTo analyze this algorithm, note that each recursive call takes linear time, exclusive of the time for a recursive call that it may make. When there is a recursive call, there is just one, and it's for a problem of at most half the size. Thus, the running time is given by the recurrence $T(n) \\le T (n / 2) + \\Theta(n)$, whose solution is $T(n) = O(n)$.\n\n\n16.2-7\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you are given two sets $A$ and $B$, each containing $n$ positive integers. You can choose to reorder each set however you like. After reordering, let $a_i$ be the $i$th element of set $A$, and let $b_i$ be the $i$th element of set $B$. You then receive a payoff of $\\prod_{i = 1}^n a_i^{b_i}$. Give an algorithm that will maximize your payoff. Prove that your algorithm maximizes the payoff, and state its running time.\n\n\n\n\nSort $A$ and $B$ into monotonically decreasing order.\n\n\nHere's a proof that this method yields an optimal solution. Consider any indices $i$ and $j$ such that $i < j$, and consider the terms $a_i^{b_i}$ and $a_j^{b_j}$. We want to show that it is no worse to include these terms in the payoff than to include $a_i^{b_j}$ and $a_j^{b_i}$, i.e., that $a_i^{b_i} a_j^{b_j} \\ge a_i^{b_j} a_j^{b_i}$. Since $A$ and $B$ are sorted into monotonically decreasing order and $i < j$, we have $a_i \\ge a_j$ and $b_i \\ge b_j$. Since $a_i$ and $a_j$ are positive and $b_i - b_j$ is nonnegative, we have $a_i^{b_i - b_j} \\ge a_j^{b_i - b_j}$. Multiplying both sides by $a_i^{b_j} a_j^{b_j}$ yields $a_i^{b_i} a_j^{b_j} \\ge a_i^{b_j} a_j^{b_i}$.\n\n\nSince the order of multiplication doesn't matter, sorting $A$ and $B$ into monotonically increasing order works as well.",

The solution is based on the optimal-substructure observation in the text: Let $i$ be the highest-numbered item in an optimal solution $S$ for $W$ pounds and items $1, \\ldots, n$. Then $S'  = S - \\{i\\}$ must be an optimal solution for $W - w_i$ pounds and items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$, and the value of the solution $S$ is $v_i$ plus the value of the subproblem solution $S'$.  We can express this relationship in the following formula: Define $c[i, w]$ to be the value of the solution for items $1, \\ldots, i$ and maximum weight $w$. Then  $$\nc[i,w] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0                                          & \\text{ if } i = 0 \\text{ or } w = 0, \\\\\nc[i - 1, w]                                & \\text{ if } w_i > w, \\\\\n\\max(v_i + c[i - 1, w - w_i], c[i - 1, w]) & \\text{ if } i > 0 \\text{ and } w \\ge w_i.\n\\end{cases}\n$$  The last case says that the value of a solution for i items either includes item $i$, in which case it is $v_i$ plus a subproblem solution for $i - 1$ items and the weight excluding $w_i$, or doesn't include item $i$, in which case it is a subproblem solution for $i - 1$ items and the same weight. That is, if the thief picks item $i$, he takes $v_i$ value, and he can choose from items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$ up to the weight limit $w - w_i$ , and get $c[i - 1, w - w_i]$ additional value. On the other hand, if he decides not to take item $i$, he can choose from items $1, \\ldots, i - 1$ up to the weight limit $w$, and get $c[i - 1, w]$ value. The better of these two choices should be made.  The algorithm takes as inputs the maximum weight $W$, the number of items $n$, and the two sequences $v = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\rangle$ and $w = \\langle w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n \\rangle$.

Now,\n\n\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n            b.freq & =   & x.freq \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a.freq & \\le & x.freq \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a.freq & =   & x.freq & \\text{(since $x.freq$ is the lowest frequency)},\n\\end{array}\n\n\nand since $y.freq \\le b.freq$,\n\n\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n            b.freq & =   & x.freq \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y.freq & \\le & x.freq \\\\\n\\Rightarrow y.freq & =   & x.freq & \\text{(since $x.freq$ is the lowest frequency)}.\n\\end{array}\n\n\nThus, if we assume that $x.freq = b.freq$, then we have that each of $a.freq$, $b.freq$, and $y.freq$ equals $x.freq$, and so \n\n\n$$a.freq = b.freq = x.freq = y.freq.$$\n\n\n16.3-2\n\n\n\n\nProve that a binary tree that is not full cannot correspond to an optimal prefix code.\n\n\n\n\nLet $T$ be a binary tree that is not full. $T$ represents a binary prefix code for a file composed of characters from alphabet $C$, where $c \\in C$, $f(c)$ is th number of occurrences of $c$ in the file. The cost of tree $T$, or the number of bits in the encoding, is  $\\sum_{c \\in C} d_T(c) \\cdot f(c)$, where $d_T(c)$ is the depth of character $c$ in tree $T$.\n\n\nLet $N$ be a node of greatest depth that has exactly one child. If $N$ is the root of $T$, $N$ can be removed and the deepth of each node reduced by one, yielding a tree representing the same alphabet with a lower cost. This mean the original code was not optimal.\n\n\nOtherwise, let $M$ be the parent of $N$, let $T_1$ be the (possibly non-existent) sibling of $N$, and let $T_2$ be the subtree rooted at the child of $N$. Replace $M$ by $N$, making the children of $N$ the roots of subtrees $T_1$ and $T_2$. If $T_1$ is empty, repeat the process. We have a new prefix code of lower cost, so the original was not optimal.\n\n\n16.3-3\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an optimal Huffman code for the following set of frequencies, based on\n\nthe first $8$ Fibonacci numbers?\n\n\n$$a:1 \\quad b:1 \\quad c:2 \\quad d:3 \\quad e:5 \\quad f:8 \\quad g:13 \\quad h:21$$\n\n\nCan you generalize your answer to find the optimal code when the frequencies are the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers?\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{array}{c|l}\na & 1111111 \\\\\nb & 1111110 \\\\\nc & 111110 \\\\\nd & 11110 \\\\\ne & 1110 \\\\\nf & 110 \\\\\ng & 10 \\\\\nh & 0\n\\end{array}\n\n\n16.3-4\n\n\n\n\nProve that we can also express the total cost of a tree for a code as the sum, over all internal nodes, of the combined frequencies of the two children of the node.\n\n\n\n\nLet tree be a full binary tree with $n$ leaves. Apply induction hypothesis on the number of leaves in $T$. When $n = 2$ (the case $n = 1$ is trivially true), there are two leaves $x$ and $y$ with the same parent $z$, then the cost of $T$ is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nB(T) & = f(x) d_T(x) + f(y) d_T(y) \\\\\n     & = f(x) + f(y) & \\text{since $d_T(x) = d_T(y) = 1$}  \\\\\n     & = f(\\text{child}_1\\text{ of }z) + f(\\text{child}_2\\text{ of }z).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the statement of theorem is true. Now suppose $n > 2$ and also suppose that theorem is true for trees on $n - 1$ leaves.\n\nLet $c_1$ and $c_2$ are two sibling leaves in $T$ such that they have the same parent $p$. Letting $T'$ be the tree obtained by deleting $c_1$ and $c_2$, by induction we know that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nB(T) & = \\sum_{\\text{leaves } l'\\in T'} f(l')d_T(l') \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{\\text{internal nodes } i'\\in T'} f(\\text{child}_1\\text{ of }i') + f(\\text{child}_2\\text{ of }i').\n\\end{align}\n\n\nUsing this information, calculates the cost of $T$.\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nB(T) & = \\sum_{\\text{leaves }l \\in T} f(l)d_T(l) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{l \\ne c_1, c_2} f(l)d_T(l) + f(c_1)d_T(c_1) - 1 + f(c_2)d_T(c_2) - 1 + f(c_1) + f(c_2) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{\\text{internal nodes }i'\\in T'} f(\\text{child}_1\\text{ of }i') + f(\\text{child}_2\\text{ of }i') + f(c_1) + f(c_2) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{\\text{internal nodes }i\\in T} f(\\text{child}_1\\text{ of }i) + f(\\text{child}_1\\text{ of }i).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus the statement is true.\n\n\n16.3-5\n\n\n\n\nProve that if we order the characters in an alphabet so that their frequencies are monotonically decreasing, then there exists an optimal code whose codeword lengths are monotonically increasing.\n\n\n\n\nIt were a contradiction to have an optimal tree whose frequencies and codewords were monotonically increasing in the strict sense; since, given $f(x_1) > \\ldots > f(x_n) \\wedge d_T(x_1) > \\cdots > d_T(x_n)$, it follows that (where $n$ is odd):\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n& f(x_1)d_T(x_1) + \\cdots + f(x_n)d_T(x_n) > f(x_1)d_T(x_n) + \\cdots + f(x_n)d_T(x_1) > 0 \\\\\n& f(x_1)(d_T(x_1) - d_T(x_n)) + \\cdots + f(x_n)(d_T(x_n) - d_T(x_1)) > 0 \\\\\n& f(x_1)(d_T(x_1) - d_T(x_n)) + \\cdots + f(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} - 1 \\rfloor})(d_T(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor - 1}) - d_T(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor + 1})) \\\\\n& > f(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} + 1 \\rfloor})(d_T(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor - 1}) - d_T(x_{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor + 1}))+ \\cdots + f(x_n)(d_T(x_1) - d_T(x_n)).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThat is, where $i$ and $j$ are the upper and lower median,\n\nrespectively; and $c_i = d_T(x_i) - d_T(x_{n - i + 1})$:\n\n\n$$f(x_1)c_1 + \\cdots + f(x_i)c_i > f(x_j)c_i + \\cdots + f(x_n)c_1$$\n\n\nsince\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf(x_i) & > f(x_{n - i + 1}) & 1 \\le i \\le \\Big\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\Big\\rfloor.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n16.3-6\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have an optimal prefix code on a set $C = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1 \\}$ of characters and we wish to transmit this code using as few bits as possible.

($\\textit{Hint:}$ Use $2n - 1$ bits to specify the structure of the tree, as discovered by a walk of the tree.)\n\n\n\n\nFirst observe that any full binary tree has exactly $2n - 1$ nodes. We can encode the structure of our full binary tree by performing a preorder traversal of $T$. \nFor each node that we record in the traversal, write a $0$ if it is an internal node and a $1$ if it is a leaf node. Since we know the tree to be full, this uniquely determines its structure. \n\n\nNext, note that we can encode any character of $C$ in $\\lceil \\lg n \\rceil$ bits.

The analysis of optimality is almost identical to the binary case. We are placing the symbols of lowest frequency lower down in the final tree and so they will have longer codewords than the more frequently occurring symbols.\n\n\n16.3-8\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a data file contains a sequence of $8$-bit characters such that all $256$ characters are about equally common: the maximum character frequency is less than twice the minimum character frequency. Prove that Huffman coding in this case is no more efficient than using an ordinary $8$-bit fixed-length code.\n\n\n\n\nFor any $2$ characters, the sum of their frequencies exceeds the frequency of any other character, so initially Huffman coding makes $128$ small trees with $2$ leaves each. At the next stage, no internal node has a label which is more than twice that of any other, so we are in the same setup as before. Continuing in this fashion, Huffman coding builds a complete binary tree of height $\\lg 256 = 8$, which is no more efficient than ordinary $8$-bit length codes.\n\n\n16.3-9\n\n\n\n\nShow that no compression scheme can expect to compress a file of randomly chosen $8$-bit characters by even a single bit. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Compare the number of possible files with the number of possible encoded files.)\n\n\n\n\nIf every possible character is equally likely, then, when constructing the Huffman code, we will end up with a complete binary tree of depth $7$. This means that every character, regardless of what it is will be represented using $7$ bits.\n\n\nThis is exactly as many bits as was originally used to represent those characters,\nso the total length of the file will not decrease at all.",

By how we defined set $X$, we know that $x \\in B'$ and $x \\notin A'$, so that $x \\in B' - A'$.

Similarly, $B - A' \\subseteq B$ and $B \\in \\mathcal I$, and so $B - A' \\in \\mathcal I$. If we show that $|A - B'| < |B - A'|$, the assumption that $(S, \\mathcal I)$ is a matroid proves the existence of $y$.\n\n\nBecause $B' - A' \\subseteq A$ and $A \\subseteq S - A'$, we can apply Fact 2 to conclude that\n\n\n$$|B' \\cap A| = |B'| - |B' \\cap A'|.$$\n\n\nWe claim that $|B \\cap A'| \\le |A' - B'|$. To see why, observe that $A' - B' = A' \\cap (S - B')$ and $B \\subseteq S - B'$, and so\n\n\n$$B \\cap A' \\subseteq (S - B') \\cap A' = A' \\cap (S - B') = A' - B'.$$\n\n\nApplying Fact 1, we see that\n\n\n$$|A' - B'| = |A'| - |A' \\cap B'| = |A'| - |B' \\cap A'|,$$\n\n\nand hence\n\n\n$$|B \\cap A'| \\le |A'| - |B' \\cap A'|.$$\n\n\nNow, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n              |A'| & < |B'|                & \\text{(by assumption)} \\\\\n|A'| - |B'\\cap A'| & < |B'| - |B' \\cap A'| & \\text{(subtracting same quantity)} \\\\\n       |B \\cap A'| & < |B'| - |B' \\cap A'| & (|B \\cap A'| \\le |A'| - |B' \\cap A'|) \\\\\n       |B \\cap A'| & < |B' \\cap A|         & (|B' \\cap A| = |B'| - |B' \\cap A'|) \\\\\n |B| - |B \\cap A'| & > |A| - |B' \\cap A|   & (|A| = |B|) \\\\\n          |B - A'| & > |A - B'|            & \\text{(Fact 1)} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\n\nNow we know there is an element $y \\in B - A'$ such that $(A - B') \\cup \\{y\\} \\in \\mathcal I$. Moreover, we claim that $y \\notin A$. To see why, we know that by the exchange property, $y \\notin A - B'$. In order for $y$ to be in $A$, it would have to be in $A \\cap B'$. But $y \\in B$, which means that $y \\notin B'$, and hence $y \\notin A \\cap B'$. Therefore $y \\notin A$.\n\n\nApplying the exchange property, we add elements in $B - A'$ to $A - B'$, maintaining that the set we get, say $C$, is in $\\mathcal I$. Then we keep applying the exchange property, adding a new element in $A - C$ to $C$, maintaining that $C$ is in $\\mathcal I$, until $|C| = |A|$. Once $|C| = |A|$, there must exist some element $x \\in A$ that we have not added into $C$. We know that such an element exists because the element $y$ that we first added into $C$ was not in $A$, and so some element $x$ in $A$ must be left over. Also, we must have $x \\in B'$ because all the elements in $A - B'$ are initially in $C$. Therefore, we have $x \\in B' - A'$.\n\n\nThe set $C$ so constructed is maximal, because it has the same cardinality as $A$, which is maximal, and $C \\in \\mathcal I$. All the elements but one in $C$ are also in $A$; the one exceptions is in $B - A'$, and so $C$ contains no elements in $A'$. Because we never added $x$ to $C$, we have that $C \\subseteq S - A' - \\{x\\} = S - (A' \\cup \\{x\\})$. Therefore, $A' \\cup \\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal I'$, as we needed to show.\n\n\n16.4-4 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nLet $S$ be a finite set and let $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k$ be a partition of $S$ into nonempty disjoint subsets.

Suppose not to achieve a contradiction, then, by minimality of $M_2$, $w(M_1) > w(M_2)$.\n\n\nRewriting both sides in terms of $w_2$, we have\n\n\n$$w_2(M_2) - (1 + W)S > w_2(M_1) - (1 + W)S,$$\n\n\nso,\n\n\n$$w_2(M_2) > w_2(M_1).$$\n\n\nThis however contradicts maximality of $M_1$ with respect to $w_2$.

Your set should include a penny so that there is a solution for every value of $n$.\n\n\nd.\n Give an $O(nk)$-time algorithm that makes change for any set of $k$ different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we go into the various parts of this problem, let us first prove once and for all that the coin-changing problem has optimal substructure.\n\n\nSuppose we have an optimal solution for a problem of making change for $n$ cents, and we know that this optimal solution uses a coin whose value is $c$ cents; let this optimal solution use $k$ coins. We claim that this optimal solution for the problem of $n$ cents must contain within it an optimal solution for the problem of $n - c$ cents. We use the usual cut-and-paste argument. Clearly, there are $k - 1$ coins in the solution to the $n - c$ cents problem used within our optimal solution to the $n$ cents problem. If we had a solution to the $n - c$ cents problem that used fewer than $k - 1$ coins, then we could use this solution to produce a solution to the $n$ cents problem that uses fewer than $k$ coins, which contradicts the optimality of our solution.\n\n\na.\n A greedy algorithm to make change using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies works as follows:\n\n\n\n\nGive $q = \\lfloor n / 25 \\rfloor$ quarters. That leaves $n_q = n \\mod 25$ cents to make change.\n\n\nThen give $d = \\lfloor n_q / 10 \\rfloor$ dimes. That leaves $n_d = n_q \\mod 10$ cents to make change.\n\n\nThen give $k = \\lfloor n_d / 5 \\rfloor$ nickels. That leaves $n_k = n_d \\mod 5$ cents to make change.\n\n\nFinally, give $p = n_k$ pennies.\n\n\n\n\nAn equivalent formulation is the following. The problem we wish to solve is making change for $n$ cents. If $n = 0$, the optimal solution is to give no coins. If $n > 0$, determine the largest coin whose value is less than or equal to $n$. Let this coin have value $c$. Give one such coin, and then recursively solve the subproblem of making change for $n - c$ cents.\n\n\nTo prove that this algorithm yields an optimal solution, we first need to show that the greedy-choice property holds, that is, that some optimal solution to making change for $n$ cents includes one coin of value $c$, where $c$ is the largest coin value such that $c \\le n$. Consider some optimal solution. If this optimal solution includes a coin of value $c$, then we are done. Otherwise, this optimal solution does not include a coin of value $c$. We have four cases to consider:\n\n\n\n\nIf $1 \\le n < 5$, then $c = 1$. A solution may consist only of pennies, and so it must contain the greedy choice.\n\n\nIf $5 \\le n < 10$, then $c = 5$. By supposition, this optimal solution does not contain a nickel, and so it consists of only pennies. Replace five pennies by one nickel to give a solution with four fewer coins.\n\n\nIf $10 \\le n < 25$, then $c = 10$. By supposition, this optimal solution does not contain a dime, and so it contains only nickels and pennies. Some subset of the nickels and pennies in this solution adds up to $10$ cents, and so we can replace these nickels and pennies by a dime to give a solution with (between $1$ and $9$) fewer coins.\n\n\nIf $25 \\le n$, then $c = 25$. By supposition, this optimal solution does not contain a quarter, and so it contains only dimes, nickels, and pennies. If it contains three dimes, we can replace these three dimes by a quarter and a nickel, giving a solution with one fewer coin. If it contains at most two dimes, then some subset of the dimes, nickels, and pennies adds up to $25$ cents, and so we can replace these coins by one quarter to give a solution with fewer coins.\n\n\n\n\nThus, we have shown that there is always an optimal solution that includes the greedy choice, and that we can combine the greedy choice with an optimal solution to the remaining subproblem to produce an optimal solution to our original problem. Therefore, the greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution.\n\n\nFor the algorithm that chooses one coin at a time and then recurses on subproblems, the running time is $\\Theta(k)$, where $k$ is the number of coins used in an optimal solution. Since $k \\le n$, the running time is $O(n)$. For our first description of the algorithm, we perform a constant number of calculations (since there are only $4$ coin types), and the running time is $O(1)$.\n\n\nb.\n When the coin denominations are $c^0, c^1, \\ldots, c^k$, the greedy algorithm to make change for $n$ cents works by finding the denomination $c^j$ such that $j = \\max \\{0 \\le i \\le k: c^i \\le n\\}$, giving one coin of denomination $c^j$, and recursing on the subproblem of making change for $n - c^j$ cents. (An equivalent, but more efficient, algorithm is to give $\\lfloor n / c^k \\rfloor$ coins of denomination $c^k$ and $\\lfloor (n \\mod c^{i + 1}) / c^i \\rfloor$ coins of denomination $c^i$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k - 1$.)\n\n\nTo show that the greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution, we start by proving the following lemma:\n\n\nLemma\n\n\nFor $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k$, let $a_i$ be the number of coins of denomination $c^i$ used in an optimal solution to the problem of making change for $n$ cents. Then for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k - 1$, we have $a_i < c$.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nIf $a_i \\ge c$ for some $0 \\le i < k$, then we can improve the solution by using one more coin of denomination $c^{i + 1}$ and $c$ fewer coins of denomination $c^i$. The amount for which we make change remains the same, but we use $c - 1 > 0$ fewer coins.\n\n\nTo show that the greedy solution is optimal, we show that any non-greedy solution is not optimal. As above, let $j = \\max\\{0 \\le i \\le k: c^i \\le n\\}$, so that the greedy solution uses at least one coin of denomination $c^j$. Consider a nongreedy solution, which must use no coins of denomination $c^j$ or higher. Let the non-greedy solution use $a_i$ coins of denomination $c^i$, for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, j - 1$; thus we have $\\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} a_i c^i = n$. Since $n \\ge c^j$, we have that $\\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} a_i c^i \\ge c^j$.. Now suppose that the non-greedy solution is optimal. By the above lemma, $a_i \\le c - 1$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, j - 1$. Thus,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} a_i c^i\n    & \\le \\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} (c - 1) c^i \\\\\n    & =   (c - 1) \\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} c^i \\\\\n    & =   (c - 1) \\frac{c^j - 1}{c - 1} \\\\\n    & =   c^j - 1 \\\\\n    & <   c^j,\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhich contradicts our earlier assertion that $\\sum_{i = 0}^{j - 1} a_i c^i \\ge c^j$. We conclude that the non-greedy solution is not optimal.\n\n\nSince any algorithm that does not produce the greedy solution fails to be optimal, only the greedy algorithm produces the optimal solution.\n\n\nThe problem did not ask for the running time, but for the more efficient greedy algorithm formulation, it is easy to see that the running time is $O(k)$, since we have to perform at most $k$ each of the division, \ufb02oor, and mod operations.\n\n\nc.\n With actual U.S. coins, we can use coins of denomination $1$, $10$, and $25$. When $n = 30$ cents, the greedy solution gives one quarter and five pennies, for a total of six coins. The non-greedy solution of three dimes is better.\n\n\nThe smallest integer numbers we can use are $1$, $3$, and $4$. When $n = 6$ cents, the greedy solution gives one $4$-cent coin and two $1$-cent coins, for a total of three coins. The non-greedy solution of two $3$-cent coins is better.\n\n\nd.\n Since we have optimal substructure, dynamic programming might apply. And indeed it does.\n\n\nLet us define $c[j]$ to be the minimum number of coins we need to make change for $j$ cents. Let the coin denominations be $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$. Since one of the coins is a penny, there is a way to make change for any amount $j \\ge 1$.\n\n\nBecause of the optimal substructure, if we knew that an optimal solution for the problem of making change for $j$ cents used a coin of denomination $d_i$, we would have $c[j] = 1 + c[j - d_i]$. As base cases, we have that $c[j] = 0$ for all $j \\le 0$.\n\n\nTo develop a recursive formulation, we have to check all denominations, giving\n\n\n$$\nc[j] =\n\\begin{cases}\n0                                                & \\text{if $j \\le 0$}, \\\\\n1 + \\min\\limits_{1 \\le i \\le k} \\{c[j - d_i]\\} & \\text{if $j > 1$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nWe can compute the $c[j]$ values in order of increasing $j$ by using a table. The following procedure does so, producing a table $c[1..n]$. It avoids even examining $c[j]$ for $j \\le 0$ by ensuring that $j \\ge d_i$ before looking up $c[j - d_i]$. The procedure also produces a table $denom[1..n]$, where $denom[j]$ is the denomination of a coin used in an optimal solution to the problem of making change for $j$ cents.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nCOMPUTE\n-\nCHANGE\n(\nn\n,\n \nd\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n    \nlet\n \nc\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n]\n \nand\n \ndenom\n[\n1.\n.\nn\n]\n \nbe\n \nnew\n \narrays\n\n    \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nc\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nk\n\n            \nif\n \nj\n \n\u2265\n \ndi\n \nand\n \n1\n \n+\n \nc\n[\nj\n \n-\n \ndi\n]\n \n<\n \nc\n[\nj\n]\n\n                \nc\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \n1\n \n+\n \nc\n[\nj\n \n-\n \ndi\n]\n\n                \ndenom\n[\nj\n]\n \n=\n \ndi\n\n    \nreturn\n \nc\n \nand\n \ndenom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis procedure obviously runs in $O(nk)$ time.\n\n\nWe use the following procedure to output the coins used in the optimal solution computed by $\\text{COMPUTE-CHANGE}$:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nGIVE\n-\nCHANGE\n(\nj\n,\n \ndenom\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nj\n \n>\n \n0\n\n        \ngive\n \none\n \ncoin\n \nof\n \ndenomination\n \ndenom\n[\nj\n]\n\n        \nGIVE\n-\nCHANGE\n(\nj\n \n-\n \ndenom\n[\nj\n],\n \ndenom\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial call is $\\text{GIVE-CHANGE}(n, denom)$.

Let $c_i$ be the \ncompletion time\n of task $a_i$ , that is, the time at which task $a_i$ completes processing. Your goal is to minimize the average completion time, that is, to minimize $(1 / n) \\sum_{i = 1}^n c_i$. For example, suppose there are two tasks, $a_1$ and $a_2$, with $p_1 = 3$ and $p_2 = 5$, and consider the schedule in which $a_2$ runs first, followed by $a_1$. Then $c_2 = 5$, $c_1 = 8$, and the average completion time is $(5 + 8) / 2 = 6.5$.

Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and state the running time of your algorithm.\n\n\nb.\n Suppose now that the tasks are not all available at once. That is, each task cannot start until its \nrelease time\n $r_i$. Suppose also that we allow \npreemption\n, so that a task can be suspended and restarted at a later time. For example, a task $a_i$ with processing time $p_i = 6$ and release time $r_i = 1$ might start running at time $1$ and be preempted at time $4$. It might then resume at time $10$ but be preempted at time $11$, and it might finally resume at time $13$ and complete at time $15$. Task $a_i$ has run for a total of $6$ time units, but its running time has been divided into three pieces. In this scenario, $a_i$'s completion time is $15$. Give an algorithm that schedules the tasks so as to minimize the average completion time in this new scenario. Prove that your algorithm minimizes the average completion time, and state the running time of your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Order the tasks by processing time from smallest to largest and run them in that order. To see that this greedy solution is optimal, first observe that the problem exhibits optimal substructure: if we run the first task in an optimal solution, then we obtain an optimal solution by running the remaining tasks in a way which minimizes the average completion time. Let $O$ be an optimal solution. Let $a$ be the task which has the smallest processing time and let b be the first task run in $O$. Let $G$ be the solution obtained by switching the order in which we run $a$ and $b$ in $O$. This amounts reducing the completion times of a and the completion times of all tasks in $G$ between $a$ and $b$ by the difference in processing times of $a$ and $b$. Since all other completion times remain the same, the average completion time of $G$ is less than or equal to the average completion time of $O$, proving that the greedy solution gives an optimal solution. This has runtime $O(n\\lg n)$ because we must first sort the elements.\n\n\nb.\n Without loss of generality we my assume that every task is a unit time task. Apply the same strategy as in part (a), except this time if a task which we would like to add next to the schedule isn't allowed to run yet, we must skip over it.

Argue that if a set of columns of $M$ is linearly independent, then the corresponding set of edges does not contain a directed cycle.\n\n\ne.\n Exercise 16.4-2 tells us that the set of linearly independent sets of columns of any matrix $M$ forms a matroid. Explain carefully why the results of parts (d) and (e) are not contradictory. How can there fail to be a perfect correspondence between the notion of a set of edges being acyclic and the notion of the associated set of columns of the incidence matrix being linearly independent?\n\n\n\n\na.\n First, suppose that a set of columns is not linearly independent over $\\mathbb F_2$ then, there is some subset of those columns, say $S$ so that a linear combination of $S$ is $0$. However, over $\\mathbb F_2$, since the only two elements are $1$ and $0$, a linear combination is a sum over some subset. \nSuppose that this subset is $S'$, note that it has to be nonempty because of linear dependence. Now, consider the set of edges that these columns correspond to. Since the columns had their total incidence with each vertex $0$ in $\\mathbb F_2$, it is even. So, if we consider the subgraph on these edges, then every vertex has a even degree. Also, since our $S'$ was nonempty, some component has an edge. Restrict our attention to any such component. Since this component is connected and has all even vertex degrees, it contains an Euler Circuit, which is a cycle. \nNow, suppose that our graph had some subset of edges which was a cycle. Then, the degree of any vertex with respect to this set of edges is even, so, when we add the corresponding columns, we will get a zero column in $\\mathbb F_2$. Since sets of linear independent columns form a matroid, by problem 16.4-2, the acyclic sets of edges form a matroid as well.\n\n\nb.\n One simple approach is to take the highest weight edge that doesn't complete a cycle. Another way to phrase this is by running Kruskal's algorithm (see Chapter 23) on the graph with negated edge weights.\n\n\nc.\n Consider the digraph on [3] with the edges $(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)$ where $(u, v)$ indicates there is an edge from $u$ to $v$. Then, consider the two acyclic subsets of edges $B = (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1)$ and $A = (1, 2), (2, 3)$. Then, adding any edge in $B - A$ to $A$ will create a cycle. So, the exchange property is violated.\n\n\nd.\n Suppose that the graph contained a directed cycle consisting of edges corresponding to columns $S$. Then, since each vertex that is involved in this cycle has exactly as many edges going out of it as going into it, the rows corresponding to each vertex will add up to zero, since the outgoing edges count negative and the incoming vertices count positive. This means that the sum of the columns in $S$ is zero, so, the columns were not linearly independent.\n\n\ne.\n There is not a perfect correspondence because we didn't show that not containing a directed cycle means that the columns are linearly  independent, so there is not perfect correspondence between these sets of independent columns (which we know to be a matriod) and the acyclic sets of edges (which we know not to be a matroid).",

We will maintain an array $D$ such that $D[i]$ contains a pointer to the task with deadline $i$. We may assume that the size of $D$ is at most $n$, since a task with deadline later than $n$ can't possibly be scheduled on time. There are at most $3n$ total $\\text{MAKE-SET}$, $\\text{UNION}$, and $\\text{FIND-SET}$ operations, each of which occur at most $n$ times, so by Theorem 21.14 the runtime is $O(n\\alpha(n))$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nSCHEDULING\n-\nVARIATIONS\n(\nA\n)\n\n    \ninitialize\n \nan\n \narray\n \nD\n \nof\n \nsize\n \nn\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n=\n \na\n[\ni\n].\ndeadline\n\n        \nif\n \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ndeadline\n]\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n            \ny\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nSET\n(\nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ndeadline\n])\n\n            \na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n=\n \ny\n.\nlow\n \n-\n \n1\n\n        \nx\n \n=\n \nMAKE\n-\nSET\n(\na\n[\ni\n])\n\n        \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n]\n \n=\n \nx\n\n        \nx\n.\nlow\n \n=\n \nx\n.\nhigh\n \n=\n \na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n\n        \nif\n \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n-\n \n1\n]\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n            \nUNION\n(\nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n-\n \n1\n],\n \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n])\n\n        \nif\n \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n+\n \n1\n]\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n            \nUNION\n(\nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n],\n \nD\n[\na\n[\ni\n].\ntime\n \n+\n \n1\n])",

            "text": "Modern computers use a cache to store a small amount of data in a fast memory. Even though a program may access large amounts of data, by storing a small subset of the main memory in the \ncache\n\u2014a small but faster memory\u2014overall access time can greatly decrease. When a computer program executes, it makes a sequence $\\langle r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n \\rangle$ of $n$ memory requests, where each request is for a particular data element. For example, a program that accesses 4 distinct elements $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ might make the sequence of requests $\\langle d, b, d, b, d, a, c, d, b, a, c, b \\rangle$. Let $k$ be the size of the cache. When the cache contains $k$ elements and the program requests the $(k + 1)$st element, the system must decide, for this and each subsequent request, which $k$ elements to keep in the cache. More precisely, for each request $r_i$, the cache-management algorithm checks whether element $r_i$ is already in the cache. If it is, then we have a \ncache hit\n; otherwise, we have a cache miss. Upon a \ncache miss\n, the system retrieves $r_i$ from the main memory, and the cache-management algorithm must decide whether to keep $r_i$ in the cache. If it decides to keep $r_i$ and the cache already holds $k$ elements, then it must evict one element to make room for $r_i$ . The cache-management algorithm evicts data with the goal of minimizing the number of cache misses over the entire sequence of requests.\n\n\nTypically, caching is an on-line problem. That is, we have to make decisions about which data to keep in the cache without knowing the future requests. Here, however, we consider the off-line version of this problem, in which we are given in advance the entire sequence of $n$ requests and the cache size $k$, and we wish to minimize the total number of cache misses.\n\n\nWe can solve this off-line problem by a greedy strategy called \nfurthest-in-future\n, which chooses to evict the item in the cache whose next access in the request sequence comes furthest in the future.\n\n\na.\n Write pseudocode for a cache manager that uses the furthest-in-future strategy. The input should be a sequence $\\langle r_1, r2, \\ldots, r_n \\rangle$ of requests and a cache size $k$, and the output should be a sequence of decisions about which data element (if any) to evict upon each request. What is the running time of your algorithm?\n\n\nb.\n Show that the off-line caching problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\nc.\n Prove that furthest-in-future produces the minimum possible number of cache misses.\n\n\n\n\na.\n The procedure $\\text{CACHE-MANAGER}$ is a generic procedure, which initializes a cache by calling $\\text{INITIALIZE-CACHE}$ and then calls $\\text{ACCESS}$ with each data element in turn. The inputs are a sequence $R = \\langle r_1, r_, \\ldots, r_n \\rangle$ of memory requests and a cache size $k$.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nCACHE\n-\nMANAGER\n(\nR\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n    \nINITIALIZE\n-\nCACHE\n(\nR\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nACCESS\n(\nri\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe running time of $\\text{CACHE-MANAGER}$ of course depends heavily on how $\\text{ACCESS}$ is implemented. We have several choices for how to implement the greedy strategy outlined in the problem. A straightforward way of implementing the greedy strategy is that when processing request $r_i$, for each of the at most $k$ elements currently in the cache, scan through requests $r_{i + 1}, \\ldots, r_n$ to find which of the elements in the cache and $r_i$ has its next access furthest in the future, and evict this element. Because each scan takes $O(n)$ time, each request entails $O(k)$ scans, and there are $n$ requests, the running time of this straightforward approach is $O(kn^2)$.\n\n\nInstead, we describe an asymptotically faster algorithm, which uses a red-black tree to check whether a given element is currently in the cache, a max-priority queue to retrieve the data element with the furthest access time, and a hash table (resolving collisions by chaining) to map data elements to integer indices. We assume that the data elements can be linearly ordered, so that it makes sense to put them into a red-black tree and a max-priority queue. The following procedure $\\text{INITIALIZE-CACHE}$ creates and initializes some global data structures that are used by ACCESS.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nINITIALIZE\n-\nCACHE\n(\nR\n,\n \nk\n)\n\n    \nlet\n \nT\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nred\n-\nblack\n \ntree\n\n    \nlet\n \nP\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nmax\n-\npriority\n \nqueue\n\n    \nlet\n \nH\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nhash\n \ntable\n\n    \nind\n \n=\n \n1\n\n    \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nj\n \n=\n \nHASH\n-\nSEARCH\n(\nri\n)\n\n        \nif\n \nj\n \n==\n \nNIL\n\n            \nHASH\n-\nINSERT\n(\nri\n,\n \nind\n)\n\n            \nlet\n \nS_\n{\nind\n}\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nlinked\n \nlist\n\n            \nj\n \n=\n \nind\n\n            \nind\n \n=\n \nind\n \n+\n \n1\n\n        \nappend\n \ni\n \nto\n \nSj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above procedure, here is the meaning of various variables:\n\n\n\n\nThe red-black tree $T$ has at most $k$ nodes and holds the distinct data elements that are currently in the cache. We assume that the red-black tree procedures are modified to keep track of the number of nodes currently in the tree, and that the procedure $\\text{TREE-SIZE}$ returns this value. Because red-black tree $T$ has at most $k$ nodes, we can insert into, delete from, or search in it in $O(\\lg k)$ worst-case time.\n\n\nThe max-priority queue $P$ contains elements with two attributes: $key$ is the next access time of a data element, and $value$ is the actual data element for each data element in the cache. $key$ gives the key and $value$ is satellite data in the priority queue. Like the red-black tree $T$, the max-priority queue contains only elements currently in the cache. We need to maintain $T$ and $P$ separately, however, because $T$ is keyed on the data elements and $P$ is keyed on access times. Using a max-heap to implement $P$, we can extract the maximum element or insert a new element in $O(\\lg k)$ time, and we can find the maximum element in $\\Theta(1)$ time.\n\n\nThe hash table $H$ is a dictionary or a map, which maps each data element to a unique integer. This integer is used to index linked lists, which are described next. We assume that the $\\text{HASH-INSERT}$ procedure uses the table-expansion technique of Section 17.4.1 to keep the hash table's load factor to be at most some constant $\\alpha$. In this way, the amortized cost per insertion is $\\Theta(1)$ and, under the assumption of simple uniform hashing, then by Theorems 11.1 and 11.2, the average-case search time is also $\\Theta(1)$.\n\n\nFor every distinct data element $r_i$, we create a linked list $S_{ind}$ (where $ind$ is obtained through the hash table) holding the indices in the input array where $r_i$ occurs. For example, if the input sequence is $\\langle d, b, d, b, d, a, c, d, b, a, c, b \\rangle$, then we create four linked lists: $S_1$ for $a$, $S_2$ for $b$, $S_3$ for $c$, and $S_4$ for $d$. $S_1$ holds the indices where $a$ is accessed, and so $S_1 = \\langle 6, 10 \\rangle$. Similarly, $S_2 = \\langle 2, 4, 9, 12 \\rangle$, $S_3 = \\langle 7, 11 \\rangle$ and $S_4 = \\langle 1, 3, 5, 8 \\rangle$.\n\n\n\n\nFor each data element $r_i$, we first check whether there is already a linked list associated with $r_i$ and create a new linked list if not. We retrieve the linked list associated with $r_i$ and append $i$ to it, indicating that an access to $r_i$ occurs at access $i$.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\nACCESS\n(\nri\n)\n\n    \n// Compute the next access time for ri.\n\n    \nind\n \n=\n \nHASH\n-\nSEARCH\n(\nri\n)\n\n    \ntime\n \n=\n \n\u221e\n\n    \ndelete\n \nthe\n \nhead\n \nof\n \nS_\n{\nind\n}\n\n    \nif\n \nS_\n{\nind\n}\n \nis\n \nnot\n \nempty\n\n        \ntime\n \n=\n \nhead\n \nof\n \nS_\n{\nind\n}\n\n    \n// Check to see whether ri is currently in the cache.\n\n    \nif\n \nTREE\n-\nSEARCH\n(\nT\n.\nroot\n,\n \nri\n)\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n        \nprint\n \n\"cache hit\"\n\n    \nelse\n \nif\n \nTREE\n-\nSIZE\n(\nT\n)\n \n<\n \nk\n\n        \n// Insert in an empty slot in the cache.\n\n        \nlet\n \nz\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nnode\n \nfor\n \nT\n\n        \nz\n.\nkey\n \n=\n \nri\n\n        \nRB\n-\nINSERT\n(\nT\n,\n \nz\n)\n\n        \nlet\n \nevent\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nobject\n \nfor\n \nP\n\n        \nevent\n.\nkey\n \n=\n \ntime\n\n        \nevent\n.\nvalue\n \n=\n \nri\n\n        \nINSERT\n(\nP\n,\n \nevent\n)\n\n        \nprint\n \n\"cache miss, inserted \"\n \nri\n \n\"in empty slot\"\n\n    \nelse\n \nevent\n \n=\n \nMAXIMUM\n(\nP\n)\n\n        \nif\n \nevent\n.\nkey\n \n\u2264\n \ntime\n     \n// ri has the furthest access time\n\n            \nprint\n \n\"cache miss, no data element evicted\"\n\n        \nelse\n \n// evict the element with furthest access time\n\n            \nprint\n \n\"cache miss, evict data element \"\n \nevent\n.\nvalue\n\n            \nevent\n \n=\n \nEXTRACT\n-\nMAX\n(\nP\n)\n\n            \nRB\n-\nDELETE\n(\nT\n,\n \nTREE\n-\nSEARCH\n(\nT\n.\nroot\n,\n \nevent\n.\nvalue\n))\n\n            \nevent\n.\nkey\n \n=\n \ntime\n\n            \nevent\n.\nvalue\n \n=\n \nri\n\n            \nINSERT\n(\nP\n,\n \nevent\n)\n\n            \nlet\n \nz\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \nnode\n \nfor\n \nT\n\n            \nz\n.\nkey\n \n=\n \nri\n\n            \nRB\n-\nINSERT\n(\nT\n,\n \nz\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe procedure $\\text{ACCESS}$ takes an input $r_i$ and decides which element to evict, if any, from the cache. The first if condition properly sets time to the next access time of $r_i$. The head of the linked list associated with $r_i$ contains $i$; we remove this element from the list, and the new head contains the next access time for $r_i$. Then, we check to see whether $r_i$ is already present in the cache. If $r_i$ is not present in the cache, we check to see whether we can store $r_i$ in an empty slot. If there are no empty slots, we have to evict the element with the furthest access time. We retrieve the element with the furthest access time from the max-priority queue and compare it with that of $r_i$ . If $r_i$'s next access is sooner, we evict the element with the furthest access time from the cache (deleting the element from the tree and from the priority queue) and insert $r_i$ into the tree and priority queue.\n\n\nUnder the assumption of simple uniform hashing, the average-case running time of $\\text{ACCESS}$ is $O(\\lg k)$, since it performs a constant number of operations on the red-black tree, priority queue, and hash table. Thus, the average-case running time of $\\text{CACHE-MANAGER}$ is $O(n\\lg k)$.\n\n\nb.\n To show that the problem exhibits optimal substructure, we define the subproblem $(C, i)$ as the contents of the cache just before the $i$th request, where $C$ is a subset of the set of input data elements containing at most $k$ of them. A \nsolution\n to $(C, i)$ is a sequence of decisions that specifies which element to evict (if any) for each request $i, i + 1, \\ldots, n$. An \noptimal solution\n to $(C, i)$ is a solution that minimizes the number of cache misses.\n\n\nLet $S$ be an optimal solution to $(C, i)$. Let $S'$ be the subsolution of $S$ for requests $i + 1, i + 2, \\ldots, n$. If a cache hit occurs on the $i$th request, then the cache remains unchanged. If a cache miss occurs, then the $i$th request results in the contents of the cache changing to $C'$ (possibly with $C' = C$ if no element was evicted). We claim that $S'$ is an optimal solution to $(C', i + 1)$. Why? If $S'$ were not an optimal solution to $(C', i + 1)$, then there exists another solution $S''$ to $(C', i + 1)$ that makes fewer cache misses than $S'$. By combining $S''$ with the decision of $S$ at the $i$th request, we obtain another solution that makes fewer cache misses than $S$, which contradicts our assumption that $S$ is an optimal solution to $(C, i)$.\n\n\nSuppose the $i$th request results in a cache miss. Let $P_C$ be the set of all cache states that can be reached from $C$ through a single decision of the cache manager. The set $P_C$ contains up to $k + 1$ states: $k$ of them arising from different elements of the cache being evicted and one arising from the decision of evicting no element. For example, if $C = {r_1, r_2, r_3}$ and the requested data element is $r_4$, then\n\n\n$$P_C = \\{\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}, \\{r_1, r_2, r_4\\}, \\{r_1, r_3, r_4\\}, \\{r_2, r_3, r_4\\}\\}.$$\nLet $miss(C, i)$ denote the minimum number of cache misses for $(C, i)$. We can state a recurrence for $miss(C, i)$ as\n\n\n$$\nmiss(C, i) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0                                                  & \\text{if $i = n$ and $r_n \\in C$}, \\\\\n1                                                  & \\text{if $i = n$ and $r_n \\notin C$}, \\\\\nmiss(C, i + 1)                                     & \\text{if $i < n$ and $r_i \\in C$}, \\\\\n1 + \\min\\limits_{C' \\in P_C} \\{miss(C', i + 1)\\} & \\text{if $i < n$ and $r_i \\notin C$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThus, we conclude that the problem exhibits optimal substructure.\n\n\nc.\n To prove that the furthest-in-future strategy yields an optimal solution, we show that the problem exhibits the greedy-choice property. Combined with the optimal-substructure property from part (b), the greedy-choice property will prove that furthest-in-future produces the minimum possible number of cache misses.\n\n\nWe use the definitions of subproblem, solution, and optimal solution from part (b). Since we will be comparing different solutions, let us define $C_{Ai}$ as the state of the cache for solution $A$ just before the ith request. The following theorem is the key.\n\n\nTheorem (Greedy-choice property)\n\n\nLet $A$ be some optimal solution to $(C, i)$. Let b be the element in $C_{Ai} \\cup \\{r_i\\}$ whose next access at the time of the $i$th request is furthest in the future, at time $m$. Then, we can construct another solution $A'$ to $(C, i)$ that has the following properties:\n\n\n\n\nOn the $i$th request, $A'$ evicts $b$.\n\n\nFor $i + 1 \\le j \\le m$, the caches $C_{Aj}$ and $C_{A' j}$ differ by at most one element. If they differ, then $b \\in C_{Aj}$ is always the element in $C_{Aj}$ that is not in $C_{A' j}$. Equivalently, if $C_{Aj}$ and $C_{A' j}$ differ, we can write $C_{Aj} = D_j \\cup \\{b\\}$ and $C_{A' j} = D_j \\cup \\{x\\}$, where $D_j$ is a size-($k - 1$) set and $x \\ne b$ is some data element.\n\n\nFor requests $i, \\ldots, m - 1$, if $A$ has a cache hit, then $A'$ has a cache hit.\n\n\n$C_{Aj} = C_{A' j}$ for $j > m$.\n\n\nFor requests $i, \\ldots, m$, the number of cache misses produced by $A'$ is at most the number of cache misses produced by $A$.\n\n\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nIf $A$ evicts $b$ at request $i$, then the proof of the theorem is trivial. Therefore, suppose $A$ evicts data element $a$ on request $i$, where $a \\ne b$. We will prove the theorem by constructing $A'$ inductively for each request.\n\n\n\n\nAt request $i$, $A'$ evicts $b$ instead of $a$.\n\n\nWe proceed with induction on $j$, where $i + 1 \\le j \\le m$. The construction for property 1 establishes the base case because $C_{A, i + 1}$ and $C_{A', i + 1}$ differ by just one element and b is the element in $C_{A, i + 1}$ that is not in $C_{A', i + 1}$.\n\n    For the induction step, suppose property 2 is true for some request $j$, where $i + 1 \\le j < m$. If $A$ does not evict any element or evicts an element in $D_j$, then construct $A'$ to make the same decision on request $j$ as $A$ makes. If $A$ evicts $b$ on request $j$, then construct $A'$ to evict $x$ and keep the same element as $A$ keeps, namely $r_j$. This construction conserves property 2 for $j + 1$. Note that this construction might sometimes insert duplicate elements in the cache. This situation can easily be dealt with by introducing a dummy element for $x$.\n\n\nSuppose $A$ has a cache hit for request $j$, where $i \\le j \\le m - 1$. Then, $r_j \\in D_j$ since $r_j \\notin C_{A' j}$. Thus, $r_j \\in C_{A' j}$ and $A'$ has a cache hit, too.\n\n\nBy property 2, the cache $C_{Am}$ differs from $C_{A' m}$ by at most one element, with $b$ being the element in $C_{Am}$ that might not be in $C_{A' m}$ . If $C_{Am} = C_{A' m}$ , then construct $A'$ to make the same decision on request $m$ as $A$. Otherwise, $C_{Am} \\ne C_{A' m}$ and $b \\in C_{Am}$. Construct $A'$ to evict $x$ and keep $b$ on request $m$. Since the $m$th request is for element $b$ and $b \\in C_{Am}$, $A$ has a cache hit so that it does not evict any element. Thus, we can ensure that $C_{A, m + 1} = C_{A', m + 1}$. From the ($m + 1$)st request on, $A'$ simply makes the same decisions as $A$.\n\n\nBy property 3, for requests $i, \\ldots, m - 1$, whenever we have a cache hit for $A$, we also have a cache hit for $A'$. Thus, we have to concern ourselves with only the $m$th request. If $A$ has a cache miss on the $m$th request, we are done. Otherwise, $A$ has a cache hit on the $m$th request, and we will prove that there exists at least one request $j$, where $i + 1 \\le j \\le m - 1$, such that the $j$th request results in a cache miss for $A$ and a cache hit for $A'$. Because $A$ evicts data element $a$ in request $i$, then, by our construction of $A'$, $C_{A', i + 1} = D_{i + 1} \\cup \\{a\\}$. The $m$th request is for data element $b$. If $A$ has a cache hit, then because none of the requests $i + 1, \\ldots, m - 1$ were for $b$, $A$ could not have evicted $b$ and brought it back. Moreover, because $A$ has a cache hit on the $m$th request, $b \\in C_{Am}$. Therefore, $A$ did not evict $b$ in any of requests $i, \\ldots, m - 1$. By our construction, $A'$ did not evict $a$. But a request for $a$ occurs at least once before the $m$th request. Consider the first such instance. At this instance, $A$ has a cache miss and $A'$ has a cache hit.\n\n\n\n\nThe above theorem and the optimal-substructure property proved in part (b) imply that furthest-in-future produces the minimum number of cache misses.",

Assign cost $3$ to the $\\text{ENQUEUE}$ operation and $0$ to the $\\text{DEQUEUE}$ operation. Recall the implementation of 10.1-6 where we enqueue by pushing on to the top of stack 1, and dequeue by popping from stack 2.\n\n\nIf stack 2 is empty, then we must pop every element from stack 1 and push it onto stack 2 before popping the top element from stack 2. For each item that we enqueue we accumulate 2 credits. Before we can dequeue an element, it must be moved to stack 2. Note: this might happen prior to the time at which we wish to dequeue it, but it will happen only once overall. One of the 2 credits will be used for  this move. Once an item is on stack 2 its pop only costs $1$ credit, which is exactly the remaining credit associated to the element. Since each operation's cost is $O(1)$, the amortized cost per operation is $O(1)$.\n\n\n17.3-7\n\n\n\n\nDesign a data structure to support the following two operations for a dynamic multiset $S$ of integers, which allows duplicate values:\n\n\n$\\text{INSERT}(S, x)$ inserts $x$ into $S$.\n\n\n$\\text{DELETE-LARGER-HALF}(S)$ deletes the largest $\\lceil |S| / 2 \\rceil$ elements from $S$.\n\n\nExplain how to implement this data structure so that any sequence of $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE-LARGER-HALF}$ operations runs in $O(m)$ time. Your implementation should also include a way to output the elements of $S$ in $O(|S|)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll store all our elements in an array, and if ever it is too large, we will copy all the elements out into an array of twice the length. \n\n\nTo delete the larger half, we first find the element $m$ with order statistic $\\lceil |S| / 2 \\rceil$ by the algor$i$thm presented in section 9.3. Then, scan through the array and copy out the elements that are smaller or equal to $m$ into an array of half the size. \n\n\nSince the delete half operation takes time $O(|S|)$ and reduces the number of elements by $\\lfloor |S| / 2 \\rfloor \\in \\Omega(|S|)$, we can make these operations take ammortized constant time by selecting our potential function to be linear in $|S|$. \n\n\nSince the insert operation only increases $|S|$ by one, we have that there is only a constant amount of work going towards satisfying the potential, so the total ammortized cost of an insertion is still constant.

Explain how to implement this data structure so that any sequence of $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE-LARGER-HALF}$ operations runs in $O(m)$ time. Your implementation should also include a way to output the elements of $S$ in $O(|S|)$ time.   We'll store all our elements in an array, and if ever it is too large, we will copy all the elements out into an array of twice the length.   To delete the larger half, we first find the element $m$ with order statistic $\\lceil |S| / 2 \\rceil$ by the algor$i$thm presented in section 9.3. Then, scan through the array and copy out the elements that are smaller or equal to $m$ into an array of half the size.   Since the delete half operation takes time $O(|S|)$ and reduces the number of elements by $\\lfloor |S| / 2 \\rfloor \\in \\Omega(|S|)$, we can make these operations take ammortized constant time by selecting our potential function to be linear in $|S|$.   Since the insert operation only increases $|S|$ by one, we have that there is only a constant amount of work going towards satisfying the potential, so the total ammortized cost of an insertion is still constant. To output all the elements just iterate through the array and output each.",

Let $k = \\lceil \\lg(n + 1) \\rceil$, and let the binary representation of $n$ be $\\langle n_{k - 1}, n_{k - 2}, \\ldots, n_0 \\rangle$. We have $k$ sorted arrays $A_0, A_1, \\ldots, A_{k - 1}$, where for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k - 1$, the length of array $A_i$ is $2^i$. Each array is either full or empty, depending on whether $n_i = 1$ or $n_i = 0$, respectively. The total number of elements held in all $k$ arrays is therefore $\\sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} n_i 2^i = n$.

Since all the individual arrays are sorted, searching one of them using a binary search algorithm takes $O(\\lg m)$ time, where $m$ is the size of the array. In an unsuccessful search, the time is $\\Theta(\\lg m)$. In the worst case, we may assume that all the arrays $A_0, A_1, \\ldots, A_{k - 1}$ are full, $k = \\lceil \\lg(n + 1) \\rceil$, and we perform an unsuccessful search. The total time taken is\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & = \\Theta(\\lg 2^{k - 1} + \\lg 2^{k - 2} + \\cdots + \\lg 2^1 + \\lg 2^0) \\\\\n     & = \\Theta((k - 1) + (k - 2) + \\cdots + 1 + 0) \\\\\n     & = \\Theta(k(k - 1) / 2) \\\\\n     & = \\Theta(\\lceil \\lg(n + 1)\\rceil(\\lceil \\lg(n + 1) \\rceil) - 1) / 2) \\\\\n     & = \\Theta(\\lg^2 n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the worst-case running time is $\\Theta(\\lg^2 n)$.\n\n\nb.\n We create a new sorted array of size $1$ containing the new element to be inserted. If array $A_0$ (which has size $1$) is empty, then we replace $A_0$ with the new sorted array. Otherwise, we merge sort the two arrays into another sorted array of size $2$. If $A_1$ is empty, then we replace $A_1$ with the new array; otherwise we merge sort the arrays as before and continue. Since array $A_i$ is of size $2^i$, if we merge sort two arrays of size $2^i$ each, we obtain one of size $2^{i + 1}$, which is the size of $A_{i + 1}$. Thus, this method will result in another list of arrays in the same structure that we had before.\n\n\nLet us analyze its worst-case running time. We will assume that merge sort takes $2m$ time to merge two sorted lists of size $m$ each. If all the arrays $A_0, A_1, \\ldots, A_{k - 2}$ are full, then the running time to fill array $A_{k - 1}$ would be\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nT(n) & = 2(2^0 + 2^1 + \\cdots + 2^{k - 2}) \\\\\n     & = 2(2^{k - 1} - 1) \\\\\n     & = 2^k - 2 \\\\\n     & = \\Theta(n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time to insert an element into this data structure is $\\Theta(n)$.\n\n\nHowever, let us now analyze the amortized running time. Using the aggregate method, we compute the total cost of a sequence of $n$ inserts, starting with the empty data structure. Let $r$ be the position of the rightmost $0$ in the binary representation $\\langle n_{k - 1}, n_{k - 2}, \\ldots, n_0 \\rangle$ of $n$, so that $n_j = 1$ for $j = 0, 1, \\ldots, r - 1$. The cost of an insertion when $n$ items have already been inserted is\n\n\n$$\\sum_{j = 0}^{r - 1} 2 \\cdot 2^j = O(2^r).$$\n\n\nFurthermore, $r = 0$ half the time, $r = 1$ a quarter of the time, and so on. There are at most $\\lceil n / 2^r \\rceil$ insertions for each value of $r$. The total cost of the $n$ operations is therefore bounded by\n\n\n$$O\\Bigg(\\sum_{r = 0}^{\\lceil \\lg(n + 1) \\rceil} \\bigg(\\bigg\\lceil \\frac{n}{2^r} \\bigg\\rceil\\bigg) 2^r \\Bigg) = O(n\\lg n).$$\n\n\nThe amortized cost per $\\text{INSERT}$ operation, therefore is $O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nWe can also use the accounting method to analyze the running time. We can charge $k$ to insert an element. $\\$1$ pays for the insertion, and we put $\\$(k - 1)$ on the inserted item to pay for it being involved in merges later on. Each time it is merged, it moves to a higher-indexed array, i.e., from $A_i$ to $A_{i + 1}$. It can move to a higher-indexed array at most $k - 1$ times, and so the $\\$(k - 1)$ on the item suffices to pay for all the times it will ever be involved in merges. Since $k = \\Theta(\\lg n)$, we have an amortized cost of $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ per insertion.\n\n\nc.\n $\\text{DELETE}(x)$ will be implemented as follows:\n\n\n\n\nFind the smallest $j$ for which the array $A_j$ with $2^j$ elements is full. Let $y$ be the last element of $A_j$.\n\n\nLet $x$ be in the array $A_i$. If necessary, find which array this is by using the search procedure.\n\n\nRemove $x$ from $A_i$ and put $y$ into $A_i$ . Then move $y$ to its correct place in $A_i$ .\n\n\nDivide $A_j$ (which now has $2^j - 1$ elements left): The first element goes into array $A_0$ , the next 2 elements go into array $A_1$ , the next 4 elements go into array $A_2$, and so forth. Mark array $A_j$ as empty. The new arrays are created already sorted.\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of $\\text{DELETE}$ is $\\Theta(n)$ in the worst case, where $i = k - 1$ and $j = k - 2: \\Theta(\\lg n)$ to find $A_j$, $\\Theta(\\lg^2 n)$ to find $A_i$, $\\Theta(2^i) = \\Theta(n)$ to put $y$ in its correct place in array $A_i$, and $\\Theta(2^j) = \\Theta(n)$ to divide array $A_j$ . The following sequence of $n$ operations, where $n / 3$ is a power of $2$, yields an amortized cost that is no better: perform $n / 3$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations, followed by $n / 3$ pairs of $\\text{DELETE}$ and $\\text{INSERT}$. It costs $O(n\\lg n)$ to do the first $n / 3$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations. This creates a single full array. Each subsequent $\\text{DELETE}$/$\\text{INSERT}$ pair costs $\\Theta(n)$ for the $\\text{DELETE}$ to divide the full array and another $\\Theta(n)$ for the $\\text{INSERT}$ to recombine it. The total is then $\\Theta(n^2)$, or $\\Theta(n)$ per operation.",

The tree as a whole is \n$\\alpha$-balanced\n if every node in the tree is $\\alpha$-balanced. The following amortized approach to maintaining weight-balanced trees was suggested by G. Varghese.\n\n\na.\n A $1 / 2$-balanced tree is, in a sense, as balanced as it can be. Given a node $x$ in an arbitrary binary search tree, show how to rebuild the subtree rooted at $x$ so that it becomes $1 / 2$-balanced. Your algorithm should run in time $\\Theta(x.size)$, and it can use $O(x.size)$ auxiliary storage.\n\n\nb.\n Show that performing a search in an $n$-node $\\alpha$-balanced binary search tree takes $O(\\lg n)$ worst-case time.\n\n\nFor the remainder of this problem, assume that the constant $\\alpha$ is strictly greater than $1 / 2$. Suppose that we implement $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ as usual for an $n$-node binary search tree, except that after every such operation, if any node in the tree is no longer $\\alpha$-balanced, then we \"rebuild\" the subtree rooted at the highest such node in the tree so that it becomes $1 / 2$-balanced.\n\n\nWe shall analyze this rebuilding scheme using the potential method. For a node $x$ in a binary search tree $T$, we define\n\n\n$$\\Delta(x) = |x.left.size - x.right.size|,$$\n\n\nand we define the potential of $T$ as\n\n\n$$\\Phi(T) = c \\sum_{x \\in T: \\Delta(x) \\ge 2} \\Delta(x),$$\n\n\nwhere $c$ is a sufficiently large constant that depends on $\\alpha$.\n\n\nc.\n Argue that any binary search tree has nonnegative potential and that a $1 / 2$-balanced tree has potential $0$.\n\n\nd.\n Suppose that $m$ units of potential can pay for rebuilding an $m$-node subtree. How large must $c$ be in terms of $\\alpha$ in order for it to take $O(1)$ amortized time to rebuild a subtree that is not $\\alpha$-balanced?\n\n\ne.\n Show that inserting a node into or deleting a node from an $n$-node $\\alpha$-balanced tree costs $O(\\lg n)$ amortized time.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Since we have $O(x.size)$ auxiliary space, we will take the tree rooted at $x$ and write down an inorder traversal of the tree into the extra space. This will only take linear time to do because it will visit each node thrice, once when passing to its left child, once when the nodes value is output and passing to the right child, and once when passing to the parent. Then, once the inorder traversal is written down, we can convert it back to a binary tree by selecting the median of the list to be the root, and recursing on the two halves of the list that remain on both sides. Since we can index into the middle element of a list in constant time, we will have the recurrence\n\n\n$$T(n) = 2T(n / 2) + 1,$$\n\n\nwhich has solution that is linear. Since both trees come from the same underlying inorder traversal, the result is a $\\text{BST}$ since the original was. Also, since the root at each point was selected so that half the elements are larger and half the elements are smaller, it is a $1 / 2$-balanced tree.\n\n\nb.\n We will show by induction that any tree with $\\le \\alpha^{-d} + d$ elements has a depth of at most $d$. This is clearly true for $d = 0$ because any tree with a single node has depth $0$, and since $\\alpha^0 = 1$, we have that our restriction on the number of elements requires there to only be one. Now, suppose that in some inductive step we had a contradiction, that is, some tree of depth $d$ that is $\\alpha$ balanced but has more than $\\alpha - d$ elements.\n\n\nWe know that both of the subtrees are alpha balanced, and by being alpha balanced at the root, we have\n\n\n$$root.left.size \\le \\alpha \\cdot root.size,$$\n\n\nwhich implies\n\n\n$$root.right.size > root.size - \\alpha \\cdot root.size - 1.$$\n\n\nSo, \n\n\n\\begin{align}\nroot.right.size & >   (1 - \\alpha)root.size - 1 \\\\\n                & >   (1 - \\alpha)\\alpha - d + d - 1 \\\\\n                & =   (\\alpha - 1 - 1)\\alpha - d + 1 + d - 1 \\\\\n                & \\ge \\alpha - d + 1 + d - 1,\n\\end{align}\n\n\nwhich is a contradiction to the fact that it held for all smaller values of $d$ because any child of a tree of depth d has depth $d - 1$.\n\n\nc.\n The potential function is a sum of $\\Delta(x)$ each of which is the absolute value of a quantity, so, since it is a sum of nonnegative values, it is nonnegative regardless of the input $\\text{BST}$.\n\n\nIf we suppose that our tree is $1 / 2$-balanced, then, for every node $x$, we'll have that $\\Delta(x) \\le 1$, so, the sum we compute to find the potential will be over no nonzero terms.\n\n\nd.\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n       \\hat c_i & =   c_i + \\Phi(D_i) - \\Phi(D_{i - 1}) \\\\\n           O(1) & =   m + \\Phi(D_i) - \\Phi(D_{i - 1}) \\\\\n\\Phi(D_{i - 1}) & =   m + \\Phi(D_i) \\\\\n\\Phi(D_{i - 1}) & \\ge m.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta(x) & =   x.left.size - x.right.size \\\\\n          & \\ge \\alpha \\cdot m - ((1 - \\alpha) m - 1) \\\\\n          & =   (2\\alpha - 1)m + 1.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nm & \\le c((2\\alpha - 1)m + 1) \\\\\nc & \\ge \\frac{m}{(2\\alpha - 1)m + 1} \\\\\n  & \\ge \\frac{1}{2\\alpha}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\ne.\n Suppose that our tree is $\\alpha$ balanced. Then, we know that performing a search takes time $O(\\lg(n))$. So, we perform that search and insert the element that we need to insert or delete the element we found. Then, we may have made the tree become unbalanced. However, we know that since we only changed one position, we have only changed the $\\Delta$ value for all of the parents of the node that we either inserted or deleted. Therefore, we can rebuild the balanced properties starting at the lowest such unbalanced node and working up. \n\n\nSince each one only takes ammortized constant time, and there are $O(\\lg(n))$ many trees made unbalanced, tot total time to rebalanced every subtree is $O(\\lg(n))$ ammortized time.",

            "text": "There are four basic operations on red-black trees that perform \nstructural modifications\n: node insertions, node deletions, rotations, and color changes. We have seen that $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ use only $O(1)$ rotations, node insertions, and node deletions to maintain the red-black properties, but they may make many more color changes.\n\n\na.\n Describe a legal red-black tree with $n$ nodes such that calling $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ to add the $(n + 1)$st node causes $\\Omega(\\lg n)$ color changes. Then describe a legal red-black tree with $n$ nodes for which calling $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ on a particular node causes $\\Omega(\\lg n)$ color changes.\n\n\nAlthough the worst-case number of color changes per operation can be logarithmic, we shall prove that any sequence of $m$ $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ operations on an initially empty red-black tree causes $O(m)$ structural modifications in the worst case. Note that we count each color change as a structural modification.\n\n\nb.\n Some of the cases handled by the main loop of the code of both $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ are \nterminating\n: once encountered, they cause the loop to terminate after a constant number of additional operations. For each of the cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$, specify which are terminating and which are not. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Look at Figures 13.5, 13.6, and 13.7.)\n\n\nWe shall first analyze the structural modifications when only insertions are performed. Let $T$ be a red-black tree, and define $\\Phi(T)$ to be the number of red nodes in $T$. Assume that $1$ unit of potential can pay for the structural modifications performed by any of the three cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$.\n\n\nc.\n Let $T'$ be the result of applying Case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ to $T$. Argue that $\\Phi(T') = \\Phi(T) - 1$.\n\n\nd.\n When we insert a node into a red-black tree using $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, we can break the operation into three parts.

Let us define, for each node $x$,\n\n\n$$\nw(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n    0 & \\text{ if } x \\text{ is red}, \\\\\n\n    1 & \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has no red children}, \\\\\n\n    0 & \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has one red children}, \\\\\n    2 & \\text{ if } x \\text{ is black and has two red children}. \\\\\n\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nNow we redefine the potential of a red-black tree $T$ as\n\n\n$$\\Phi(T) = \\sum_{x \\in T} w(x),$$\n\n\nand let $T'$ be the tree that results from applying any nonterminating case of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ or $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ to $T$.\n\n\nf.\n Show that $\\Phi(T') \\le \\Phi(T) - 1$ for all nonterminating cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ is $O(1)$.\n\n\ng.\n Show that $\\Phi(T') \\le \\Phi(T) - 1$ for all nonterminating cases of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$. Argue that the amortized number of structural modifications performed by any call of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ is $O(1)$.\n\n\nh.\n Complete the proof that in the worst case, any sequence of $m$ $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ operations performs $O(m)$ structural modifications.\n\n\n\n\na.\n For $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, consider a complete red-black tree in which the colors alternate between levels. That is, the root is black, the children of the root are red, the grandchildren of the root are black, the great-grandchildren of the root are red, and so on. When a node is inserted as a red child of one of the red leaves, then case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ occurs $(\\lg(n + 1)) / 2$ times, so that there are \u007f$\\Omega(\\lg n)$ color changes to fix the colors of nodes on the path from the inserted node to the root.\n\n\nFor $\\text{RB-DELETE}$, consider a complete red-black tree in which all nodes are black. If a leaf is deleted, then the double blackness will be pushed all the way up to the root, with a color change at each level (case 2 of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$), for a total of \u007f$\\Omega(\\lg n)$ color changes.\n\n\nb.\n All cases except for case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ and case 2 of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ are terminating.\n\n\nc.\n Case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ reduces the number of red nodes by $1$. As Figure 13.5 shows, node $z$'s parent and uncle change from red to black, and $z$'s grandparent changes from black to red. Hence, $\\Phi(T') = \\Phi(T) - 1$.\n\n\nd.\n Lines 1\u201316 of $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ cause one node insertion and a unit increase in potential. The nonterminating case of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ (Case 1) makes three color changes and decreases the potential by $1$. The terminating cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ (cases 2 and 3) cause one rotation each and do not affect the potential. (Although case 3 makes color changes, the potential does not change. As Figure 13.6 shows, node $z$'s parent changes from red to black, and $z$'s grandparent changes from black to red.)\n\n\ne.\n The number of structural modifications and amount of potential change resulting from lines 1\u201316 of $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and from the terminating cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ are $O(1)$, and so the amortized number of structural modifications of these parts is $O(1)$. The nonterminating case of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ may repeat $O(\\lg n)$ times, but its amortized number of structural modifications is $0$, since by our assumption the unit decrease in the potential pays for the structural modifications needed. Therefore, the amortized number of structural modifications performed by $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ is $O(1)$.\n\n\nf.\n From Figure 13.5, we see that case 1 of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ makes the following changes to the tree:\n\n\n\n\nChanges a black node with two red children (node $C$) to a red node, resulting in a potential change of $-2$.\n\n\nChanges a red node (node $A$ in part (a) and node $B$ in part (b)) to a black node with one red child, resulting in no potential change.\n\n\nChanges a red node (node $D$) to a black node with no red children, resulting in a potential change of $1$.\n\n\n\n\nThe total change in potential is $-1$, which pays for the structural modifications performed, and thus the amortized number of structural modifications in case 1 (the nonterminating case) is $0$. The terminating cases of $\\text{RB-INSERT-FIXUP}$ cause $O(1)$ structural changes. Because $w(v)$ is based solely on node colors and the number of color changes caused by terminating cases is $O(1)$, the change in potential in terminating cases is $O(1)$. Hence, the amortized number of structural modifications in the terminating cases is $O(1)$. The overall amortized number of structural modifications in $\\text{RB-INSERT}$, therefore, is $O(1)$.\n\n\ng.\n Figure 13.7 shows that case 2 of $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$ makes the following changes to the tree:\n\n\n\n\nChanges a black node with no red children (node $D$) to a red node, resulting in a potential change of $-1$.\n\n\nIf $B$ is red, then it loses a black child, with no effect on potential.\n\n\nIf $B$ is black, then it goes from having no red children to having one red child, resulting in a potential change of $-1$. \n\n\n\n\nThe total change in potential is either $-1$ or $-2$, depending on the color of $B$. In either case, one unit of potential pays for the structural modifications performed, and thus the amortized number of structural modifications in case 2 (the nonterminating case) is at most $0$. The terminating cases of $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ cause $O(1)$ structural changes. Because $w(v)$ is based solely on node colors and the number of color changes caused by terminating cases is $O(1)$, the change in potential in terminating cases is $O(1)$. Hence, the amortized number of structural changes in the terminating cases is $O(1)$. The overall amortized number of structural modifications in $\\text{RB-DELETE-FIXUP}$, therefore, is $O(1)$.\n\n\nh.\n Since the amortized number structural modification in each operation is $O(1)$, the actual number of structural modifications for any sequence of $m$ $\\text{RB-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RB-DELETE}$ operations on an initially empty red-black tree is $O(m)$ in the worst case.",

When we search for an element in the list, we are given a key, and we want to find an element with that key.\n\n\nA self-organizing list has two important properties:\n\n\n\n\nTo find an element in the list, given its key, we must traverse the list from the beginning until we encounter the element with the given key. If that element is the $k$th element from the start of the list, then the cost to find the element is $k$.\n\n\nWe may reorder the list elements after any operation, according to a given rule with a given cost. We may choose any heuristic we like to decide how to reorder the list.\n\n\n\n\nAssume that we start with a given list of $n$ elements, and we are given an access sequence $\\sigma = \\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_m \\rangle$ of keys to find, in order. The cost of the sequence is the sum of the costs of the individual accesses in the sequence.\n\n\nOut of the various possible ways to reorder the list after an operation, this problem focuses on transposing adjacent list elements-switching their positions in the list\u2014with a unit cost for each transpose operation. You will show, by means of a potential function, that a particular heuristic for reordering the list, move-to-front, entails a total cost no worse than $4$ times that of any other heuristic for maintaining the list order\u2014even if the other heuristic knows the access sequence in advance! We call this type of analysis a \ncompetitive analysis\n.\n\n\nFor a heuristic $H$ and a given initial ordering of the list, denote the access cost of sequence $\\sigma$ by $C_H(\\sigma)$ Let $m$ be the number of accesses in $\\sigma$.\n\n\na.\n Argue that if heuristic $\\text H$ does not know the access sequence in advance, then the worst-case cost for $\\text H$ on an access sequence $\\sigma$ is $C_H(\\sigma) = \\Omega(mn)$.\n\n\nWith the \nmove-to-front\n heuristic, immediately after searching for an element $x$, we move $x$ to the first position on the list (i.e., the front of the list).\n\n\nLet $\\text{rank}_L(x)$ denote the rank of element $x$ in list $L$, that is, the position of $x$ in list $L$. For example, if $x$ is the fourth element in $L$, then $\\text{rank}_L(x) = 4$. Let $c_i$ denote the cost of access $\\sigma_i$ using the move-to-front heuristic, which includes the cost of finding the element in the list and the cost of moving it to the front of the list by a series of transpositions of adjacent list elements.\n\n\nb.\n Show that if $\\sigma_i$ accesses element $x$ in list $L$ using the move-to-front heuristic, then $c_i = 2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$.\n\n\nNow we compare move-to-front with any other heuristic $\\text H$ that processes an access sequence according to the two properties above. Heuristic $\\text H$ may transpose elements in the list in any way it wants, and it might even know the entire access sequence in advance.\n\n\nLet $L_i$ be the list after access $\\sigma_i$ using move-to-front, and let $L_i^*$ be the list after access $\\sigma_i$ using heuristic $\\text H$. We denote the cost of access $\\sigma_i$ by $c_i$ for move-to-front and by $c_i^*$ for heuristic $\\text H$. Suppose that heuristic $\\text H$ performs $t_i^*$ transpositions during access $\\sigma_i$.\n\n\nc.\n In part (b), you showed that $c_i = 2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) - 1$. Now show that $c_i^* = \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}^*}(x) + t_i^*$.\n\n\nWe define an \ninversion\n in list $L_i$ as a pair of elements $y$ and $z$ such that $y$ precedes $z$ in $L_i$ and $z$ precedes $y$ in list $L_i^*$. Suppose that list $L_i$ has $q_i$ inversions after processing the access sequence $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_i \\rangle$. Then, we define a potential function $\\Phi$ that maps $L_i$ to a real number by $\\Phi(L_i) = 2q_i$. For example, if $L_i$ has the elements $\\langle e, c, a, d, b \\rangle$ and $L_i^*$ has the elements $\\langle c, a, b, d, e \\rangle$, then $L_i$ has 5 inversions $((e, c), (e, a), (e, d), (e, b), (d, b))$, and so $\\Phi(L_i) = 10$. Observe that $\\Phi(L_i) \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and that, if move-to-front and heuristic $\\text H$ start with the same list $L_0$, then $\\Phi(L_0) = 0$.\n\n\nd.\n Argue that a transposition either increases the potential by $2$ or decreases the potential by $2$.\n\n\nSuppose that access $\\sigma_i$ finds the element $x$. To understand how the potential changes due to $\\sigma_i$, let us partition the elements other than $x$ into four sets, depending on where they are in the lists just before the $i$th access:\n\n\n\n\nSet $A$ consists of elements that precede $x$ in both $L_{i - 1}$ and $L_{i - 1}^*$.\n\n\nSet $B$ consists of elements that precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$ and follow $x$ in $L_{i - 1}^*$.\n\n\nSet $C$ consists of elements that follow $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$ and precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}^*$.\n\n\nSet $D$ consists of elements that follow $x$ in both $L_{i - 1}$ and $L_{i - 1}^*$.\n\n\n\n\ne.\n Argue that $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) = |A| + |B| + 1$ and $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}^*}(x) = |A| + |C| + 1$.\n\n\nf.\n Show that access $\\sigma_i$ causes a change in potential of\n\n\n$$\\Phi(L_i) - \\Phi(L_{i - 1}) \\le 2(|A| - |B| + t_i^*),$$\n\n\nwhere, as before, heuristic $\\text H$ performs $t_i^*$ transpositions during access $\\sigma_i$.\n\n\nDefine the amortized cost $\\hat c_i$ of access $\\sigma_i$ by $\\hat c_i = c_i + \\Phi(L_i) - \\Phi(L_{i - 1})$.\n\n\ng.\n Show that the amortized cost $\\hat c_i$ of access $\\sigma_i$ is bounded from above by $4c_i^*$.\n\n\nh.\n Conclude that the cost $C_{\\text{MTF}}(\\sigma)$ of access sequence $\\sigma$ with move-to-front is at most $4$ times the cost $C_H(\\sigma)$ of $\\sigma$ withany other heuristic $\\text H$, assuming that both heuristics start with the same list.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Since the heuristic is picked in advance, given any sequence of requests given so far, we can simulate what ordering the heuristic will call for, then, we will pick our next request to be whatever element will of been in the last position of the list. Continuing until all the requests have been made, we have that the cost of this sequence of accesses is $= mn$.\n\n\nb.\n The cost of finding an element is $= \\text{rank}_L(x)$ and since it needs to be swapped with all the elements before it, of which there are $\\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$, the total cost is $2 \\cdot \\text{rank}_L(x) - 1$.\n\n\nc.\n Regardless of the heuristic used, we first need to locate the element, which is left where ever it was after the previous step, so, needs $\\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x)$. After that, by definition, there are $t_i$ transpositions made, so, $c^*_i = \\text{rank}_{L_{i - 1}}(x) + t_i^*$.\n\n\nd.\n If we perform a transposition of elements $y$ and $z$, where $y$ is towards the left. Then there are two cases. The first is that the final ordering of the list in $L_i^*$ is with $y$ in front of $z$, in which case we have just increased the number of inversions by $1$, so the potential increases by $2$. The second is that in $L_I^*z$ occurs before $y$, in which case, we have just reduced the number of inversions by one, reducing the potential by $2$. \n\n\nIn both cases, whether or not there is an inversion between $y$ or $z$ and any other element has not changed, since the transposition only changed the relative ordering of those two elements.\n\n\ne.\n By definition, $A$ and $B$ are the only two of the four categories to place elements that precede $x$ in $L_{i - 1}$, since there are $|A| + |B|$ elements preceding it, it's rank in $L_{i - 1}$ is $|A| + |B| + 1$. Similarly, the two categories in which an element can be if it precedes $x$ in $L^*_{i - 1}$ are $A$ and $C$, so, in $L^*_{i - 1}$, $x$ has $\\text{rank} |A| + |C| + 1$.\n\n\nf.\n We have from part d that the potential increases by $2$ if we transpose two elements that are being swapped so that their relative order in the final ordering is being screwed up, and decreases by two if they are begin placed into their correct order in $L^*_i$. \n\n\nIn particular, they increase it by at most $2$, since we are keeping track of the number of inversions that may not be the direct effect of the transpositions that heuristic $H$ made, we see which ones the Move to front heuristic may of added. In particular, since the move to front heuristic only changed the relative order of $x$ with respect to the other elements, moving it in front of the elements that preceded it in $L_{i - 1}$, we only care about sets $A$ and $B$. For an element in $A$, moving it to be behind $A$ created an inversion, since that element preceded $x$ in $L^*_i$. However, if the element were in $B$, we are removing an inversion by placing $x$ in front of it.\n\n\ng.\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat c_i & \\le 2(|A| + |B| + 1) - 1 + 2(|A| - |B| + t_i^*) \\\\\n         & =   4|A| + 1 + 2 t_i^* \\\\\n         & \\le 4(|A| + |C| + 1 + t_i^*) \\\\\n         & =   4 c_i^*.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nh.\n We showed that the amortized cost of each operation under the move to front heuristic was at most four times the cost of the operation using any other heuristic. Since the amortized cost added up over all these operation is at most the total (real) cost, so we have that the total cost with movetofront is at most four times the total cost with an arbitrary other heuristic.",

Unless $n = 1$ there cannot ever be $n$ nodes since we only ever insert a key into a non-empty node, so there will always be at least one node with $2$ keys. \n\n\nNext observe that we will never have more than one key in a node which is not a right spine of our B-tree. This is because every key we insert is larger than all keys stored in the tree, so it will be inserted into the right spine of the tree. Nodes not in the right spine are a result of splits, and since $t = 2$, every split results in child nodes with one key each. The fewest possible number of nodes occurs when every node in the right spine has $3$ keys. In this case, $n = 2h + 2^{h + 1} - 1$ where $h$ is the height of the B-tree, and the number of nodes is $2^{h + 1} - 1$. Asymptotically these are the same, so the number of nodes is $\\Theta(n)$.\n\n\n18.2-5\n\n\n\n\nSince leaf nodes require no pointers to children, they could conceivably use a different (larger) $t$ value than internal nodes for the same disk page size.

Also, if an element needs to be inserted into a full leaf, we would split the leaf into two separate leaves, each of which doesn't have too many keys stored in it.\n\n\n18.2-6\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we were to implement $\\text{B-TREE-SEARCH}$ to use binary search rather than linear search within each node. Show that this change makes the CPU time required $O(\\lg n)$, independently of how $t$ might be chosen as a function of $n$.\n\n\n\n\nAs in the $\\text{TREE-SEARCH}$ procedure for binary search trees, the nodes encountered during the recursion form a simple path downward from the root of the tree. Thus, the $\\text{B-TREE-SEARCH}$ procedure needs $O(h) = O(\\log_t n)$ CPU time to search along the path, where $h$ is the height of the B-tree and $n$ is the number of keys in the B-tree, and we know that $h \\le \\log_t \\frac{n + 1}{2}$. Since the number of keys in each nodeis less than $2t - 1$, a binary search within each node is $O(\\lg t)$. So the total time is:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nO(\\lg t \\cdot \\log_t n) & = O(\\lg t \\cdot \\frac{\\lg n}{\\lg t}) & \\text{by changing the base of the logarithm.} \\\\\n                        & = O(\\lg n).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the CPU time required is $O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\n18.2-7\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that disk hardware allows us to choose the size of a disk page arbitrarily, but that the time it takes to read the disk page is $a + bt$, where $a$ and $b$ are specified constants and $t$ is the minimum degree for a B-tree using pages of the selected size.

            "text": "Consider implementing a stack in a computer that has a relatively small amount of fast primary memory and a relatively large amount of slower disk storage. The operations $\\text{PUSH}$ and $\\text{POP}$ work on single-word values. The stack we wish to support can grow to be much larger than can fit in memory, and thus most of it must be stored on disk.\n\n\nA simple, but inefficient, stack implementation keeps the entire stack on disk. We maintain in - memory a stack pointer, which is the disk address of the top element on the stack. If the pointer has value $p$, the top element is the $(p \\mod m)$th word on page $\\lfloor p / m \\rfloor$ of the disk, where $m$ is the number of words per page.\n\n\nTo implement the $\\text{PUSH}$ operation, we increment the stack pointer, read the appropriate page into memory from disk, copy the element to be pushed to the appropriate word on the page, and write the page back to disk. A $\\text{POP}$ operation is similar. We decrement the stack pointer, read in the appropriate page from disk, and return the top of the stack. We need not write back the page, since it was not modified.\n\n\nBecause disk operations are relatively expensive, we count two costs for any implementation: the total number of disk accesses and the total CPU time. Any disk access to a page of $m$ words incurs charges of one disk access and $\\Theta(m)$ CPU time.\n\n\na.\n Asymptotically, what is the worst-case number of disk accesses for $n$ stack operations using this simple implementation? What is the CPU time for $n$ stack operations? (Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $n$ for this and subsequent parts.)\n\n\nNow consider a stack implementation in which we keep one page of the stack in memory. (We also maintain a small amount of memory to keep track of which page is currently in memory.) We can perform a stack operation only if the relevant disk page resides in memory. If necessary, we can write the page currently in memory to the disk and read in the new page from the disk to memory. If the relevant disk page is already in memory, then no disk accesses are required.\n\n\nb.\n What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for $n$ $\\text{PUSH}$ operations? What is the CPU time?\n\n\nc.\n What is the worst-case number of disk accesses required for $n$ stack operations? What is the CPU time?\n\n\nSuppose that we now implement the stack by keeping two pages in memory (in addition to a small number of words for bookkeeping).\n\n\nd.\n Describe how to manage the stack pages so that the amortized number of disk accesses for any stack operation is $O(1 / m)$ and the amortized CPU time for any stack operation is $O(1)$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n We will have to make a disk access for each stack operation. Since each of these disk operations takes time $\\Theta(m)$, the CPU time is $\\Theta(mn)$.\n\n\nb.\n Since only every mth push starts a new page, the number of disk operations is approximately $n / m$, and the CPU runtime is $\\Theta(n)$, since both the contribution from the cost of the disk access and the actual running of the push operations are both $\\Theta(n)$.\n\n\nc.\n If we make a sequence of pushes until it just spills over onto the second page, then alternate popping and pulling many times, the asymptotic number of disk accesses and CPU time is of the same order as in part a. This is because when we are doing that alternating of pops and pushes, each one triggers a disk access. \n\n\nd.\n We define the potential of the stack to be the absolute value of the difference between the current size of the stack and the most recently passed multiple of $m$. This potential function means that the initial stack which has size $0$, is also a multiple of $m$, so the potential is zero. Also, as we do a stack operation we either increase or decrease the potential by one. For us to have to load a new page from disk and write an old one to disk, we would need to be at least $m$ positions away from the most recently visited multiple of $m$, because we would have had to just cross a page boundary. This cost of loading and storing a page takes (real) cpu time of $\\Theta(m)$. However, we just had a drop in the potential function of order $\\Theta(m)$. So, the amortized cost of this operation is $O(1)$.",

It returns a set $S = S' \\cup \\{x\\} \\cup S''$. The \nsplit\n operation is like an \"inverse\" join: given a dynamic set $S$ and an element $x \\in S$, it creates a set $S'$ that consists of all elements in set $S$ and an element $x \\in S$, it creates a set $S'$ that consists of all elements in $S - \\{x\\}$ whose keys are less than $x.key$ and a set $S''$ that consists of all elements in $S - \\{x\\}$ whose keys are greater than $x.key$. In this problem, we investigate how to implement these operations on 2-3-4 trees. We assume for convenience that elements consist only of keys and that all key values are distinct.\n\n\na.\n Show how to maintain, for every node $x$ of a 2-3-4 tree, the height of the subtree rooted at $x$ as an attribute $x.height$. Make sure that your implementation does not affect the asymptotic running times of searching, insertion, and deletion.\n\n\nb.\n Show how to implement the join operation. Given two 2-3-4 trees $T'$ and $T''$ and a key $k$, the join operation should run in $O(1 + |h' - h''|)$ time, where $h'$ and $h''$ are the heights of $T'$ and $T''$, respectively.\n\n\nc.\n Consider the simple path $p$ from the root of a 2-3-4 tree $T$ to a given key $k$, the set $S'$ of keys in $T$ that are less than $k$, and the set $S''$ of keys in $T$ that are greater than $k$. Show that $p$ breaks $S'$ into a set of trees $\\{T'_0, T'_1, \\ldots, T'_m\\}$ and a set of keys $\\{k'_1, k'_2, \\ldots, k'_m\\}$, where, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$, we have $y < k'_i < z$ for any keys $y \\in T'_{i - 1}$ and $z \\in T'_i$. What is the relationship between the heights of $T'_{i - 1}$ and $T'_i$? Describe how $p$ breaks $S''$ into sets of trees and keys.\n\n\nd.\n Show how to implement the split operation on $T$. Use the join operation to assemble the keys in $S'$ into a single 2-3-4 tree $T'$ and the keys in $S''$ into a single 2-3-4 tree $T''$. The running time of the split operation should be $O(\\lg n)$, where $n$ is the number of keys in $T$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ The costs for joining should telescope.)\n\n\n\n\na.\n For insertion it will suffice to explain how to update height when we split a node. Suppose node $x$ is split into nodes $y$ and $z$, and the median of $x$ is merged into node $w$. The height of $w$ remains unchanged unless $x$ was the root (in which case $w.height = x.height + 1$).\n\n\nThe height of $y$ or $z$ will often change. We set\n\n\n$$y.height = \\max_i y.c_i .height + 1$$\n\n\nand\n\n\n$$z.height = \\max_i z.c_i.height + 1.$$\n\n\nEach update takes $O(t)$. Since a call to $\\text{B-TREE-INSERT}$ makes at most $h$ splits where $h$ is the height of the tree, the total time it takes to update heights is $O(th)$, preserving the asymptotic running time of insert. For deletion the situation is even simple. The only time the height changes is when the root has a single node and it is merged with its subtree nodes, leaving an empty root node to be deleted. In this case, we update the height of the new node to be the (old) height of the root minus $1$.\n\n\nb.\n Without loss of generality, assume $h' \\ge h''$. We essentially wish to merge $T''$ into $T'$ at a node of height $h''$ using node $x$. To do this, find the node at depth $h' - h''$ on the right spine of $T'$. Add $x$ as a key to this node, and $T''$ as the additional child. If it should happen that the node was already full, perform a split operation.\n\n\nc.\n Let $x_i$ be the node encountered after $i$ steps on path $p$. Let $l_i$ be the index of the largest key stored in $x_i$ which is less than or equal to $k$. We take $k_i' = x_i.key_{l_i}$ and $T'_{i - 1}$ to be the tree whose root node consists of the keys in $x_i$ which are less than $x_i.key_{l_i}$, and all of their children. In general, $T'_{i - 1}.height \\ge T'_i.height$.\n\n\nFor $S''$, we take a similar approach. They keys will be those in nodes passed on $p$ which are immediately greater than $k$, and the trees will be rooted at a node consisting of the larger keys, with the associated subtrees. When we reach the node which contains $k$, we don't assign a key, but we do assign a tree.\n\n\nd.\n Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be empty trees. Consider the path $p$ from the root of $T$ to $k$. Suppose we have reached node $x_i$. We join tree $T'_{i - 1}$ to $T_1$, then insert $k' i$ into $T_1$. We join $T''_{i - 1}$ to $T_2$ and insert $k''_i$ into $T_2$. Once we have encountered the node which contains $k$ at $x_m.key_k$, join $x_m.c_k$ with $T_1$ and $x_m.c_{k + 1}$ with $T_2$.\n\n\nWe will perform at most $2$ join operations and $1$ insert operation for each level of the tree. Using the runtime determined in part (b), and the fact that when we join a tree $T'$ to $T_1$ (or $T''$ to $T_2$ respectively) the height difference is\n\n\n$$T'.height - T_1.height.$$\n\n\nSince the heights are nondecreasing of successive tree that are joined, we get a telescoping sum of heights. The first tree has height $h$, where $h$ is the height of $T$, and the last tree has height $0$. Thus, the runtime is\n\n\n$$O(2(h + h)) = O(\\lg n).$$",

(The rule in Section 19.3 uses $k = 2$.) For what values of $k$ is $D(n) = O(\\lg n)$?\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the proof of lemma 19.1, if $x$ is any node if a Fibonacci heap, $x.degree = m$, and $x$ has children $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_m$, then $y_1.degree \\ge 0$ and $y_i.degree \\ge i - k$. Thus, if $s_m$ denotes the fewest nodes possible in a node of degree $m$, then we have $s_0 = 1, s_1 = 2, \\ldots, s_{k - 1} = k$ and in general, $s_m = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^{m - k} s_i$. Thus, the difference between $s_m$ and $s_{m - 1}$ is $s_{m - k}$.\n\n\nLet ${f_m}$ be the sequence such that $f_m = m + 1$ for $0 \\le m < k$ and $f_m = f_{m - 1} + f_{m - k}$ for $m \\ge k$.\n\n\nIf $F(x)$ is the generating function for $f_m$ then we have $F(x) = \\frac{1 - x^k}{(1 - x)(1 - x - x^k)}$. Let $\\alpha$ be a root of $x^k = x^{k - 1} + 1$. We'll show by induction that $f_{m + k} \\ge \\alpha^m$. For the base cases:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n      f_k & = k + 1 \\ge 1 = \\alpha^0 \\\\\nf_{k + 1} & = k + 3 \\ge \\alpha^1 \\\\\n          & \\vdots \\\\\nf_{k + k} & = k + \\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} = k + k + 1 + \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \\ge 2k + 1+\\alpha^{k - 1} \\ge \\alpha^k.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nIn general, we have\n\n\n$$f_{m + k} = f_{m + k - 1} + f_m \\ge \\alpha^{m - 1} + \\alpha^{m - k}  = \\alpha^{m - k}(\\alpha^{k - 1} + 1) = \\alpha^m.$$\n\n\nNext we show that $f_{m + k} = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^m f_i$. The base case is clear, since $f_k = f_0 + k = k + 1$. For the induction step, we have\n\n\n$$f_{m + k} = f_{m - 1 - k} + f_m = k \\sum_{i = 0}^{m - 1} f_i + f_m = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^m f_i.$$\n\n\nObserve that $s_i \\ge f_{i + k}$ for $0 \\le i < k$.

For the base cases:  \\begin{align}\n      f_k & = k + 1 \\ge 1 = \\alpha^0 \\\\\nf_{k + 1} & = k + 3 \\ge \\alpha^1 \\\\\n          & \\vdots \\\\\nf_{k + k} & = k + \\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} = k + k + 1 + \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \\ge 2k + 1+\\alpha^{k - 1} \\ge \\alpha^k.\n\\end{align}  In general, we have  $$f_{m + k} = f_{m + k - 1} + f_m \\ge \\alpha^{m - 1} + \\alpha^{m - k}  = \\alpha^{m - k}(\\alpha^{k - 1} + 1) = \\alpha^m.$$  Next we show that $f_{m + k} = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^m f_i$. The base case is clear, since $f_k = f_0 + k = k + 1$. For the induction step, we have  $$f_{m + k} = f_{m - 1 - k} + f_m = k \\sum_{i = 0}^{m - 1} f_i + f_m = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^m f_i.$$  Observe that $s_i \\ge f_{i + k}$ for $0 \\le i < k$. Again, by induction, for $m \\ge k$ we have  $$s_m = k + \\sum_{i = 0}^{m - k} s_i \\ge k + \\sum_{i = 0}^{m - k} f_{i + k} \\ge k + \\sum_{i = 0}^m f_i = f_{m + k}.$$  So in general, $s_m \\ge f_{m + k}$. Putting it all together, we have  \\begin{align}\nsize(x) & \\ge s_m \\\\\n        & \\ge k + \\sum_{i = k}^m s_{i - k} \\\\\n        & \\ge k + \\sum_{i = k}^m f_i \\\\\n        & \\ge f_{m + k} \\\\\n        & \\ge \\alpha^m.\n\\end{align}  Taking logs on both sides, we have  $$\\log_\\alpha n \\ge m.$$  In other words, provided that $\\alpha$ is a constant, we have a logarithmic bound on the maximum degree.",

Discuss the relationship between the binomial trees that $H$ contains and the binary representation of $n$. Conclude that $H$ consists of at most $\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor + 1$ binomial trees.\n\n\nSuppose that we represent a binomial heap as follows. The left-child, right-sibling scheme of Section 10.4 represents each binomial tree within a binomial heap. Each node contains its key; pointers to its parent, to its leftmost child, and to the sibling immediately to its right (these pointers are $\\text{NIL}$ when appropriate); and its degree (as in Fibonacci heaps, how many children it has). The roots form a singly linked root list, ordered by the degrees of the roots (from low to high), and we access the binomial heap by a pointer to the first node on the root list.\n\n\nc.\n Complete the description of how to represent a binomial heap (i.e., name the attributes, describe when attributes have the value $\\text{NIL}$, and define how the root list is organized), and show how to implement the same seven operations on binomial heaps as this chapter implemented on Fibonacci heaps. Each operation should run in $O(\\lg n)$ worst-case time, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the binomial heap (or in the case of the $\\text{UNION}$ operation, in the two binomial heaps that are being united). The $\\text{MAKE-HEAP}$ operation should take constant time.\n\n\nd.\n Suppose that we were to implement only the mergeable-heap operations on a Fibonacci heap (i.e., we do not implement the $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ or $\\text{DELETE}$ operations). How would the trees in a Fibonacci heap resemble those in a binomial heap? How would they differ? Show that the maximum degree in an $n$-node Fibonacci heap would be at most $\\lfloor \\lg n\\rfloor$.\n\n\ne.\n Professor McGee has devised a new data structure based on Fibonacci heaps. A McGee heap has the same structure as a Fibonacci heap and supports just the mergeable-heap operations. The implementations of the operations are the same as for Fibonacci heaps, except that insertion and union consolidate the root list as their last step. What are the worst-case running times of operations on McGee heaps?\n\n\n\n\na.\n\n\n\n\n$B_k$ consists of two binomial trees $B_{k - 1}$.\n\n\nThe height of one $B_{k - 1}$ is increased by $1$.\n\n\nFor $i = 0$, $\\binom{k}{0} = 1$ and only root is at depth $0$. Suppose in $B_{k - 1}$, the number of nodes at depth $i$ is $\\binom{k - 1}{i}$, in $B_k$, the number of nodes at depth $i$ is $\\binom{k - 1}{i} + \\binom{k - 1}{i - 1} = \\binom{k}{i}$.\n\n\nThe degree of the root increase by $1$.\n\n\n\n\nb.\n Let $n.b$ denote the binary expansion of $n$. The fact that we can have at most one of each binomial tree corresponds to the fact that we can have at most $1$ as any digit of $n.b$. Since each binomial tree has a size which is a power of $2$, the binomial trees required to represent n nodes are uniquely determined. We include $B_k$ if and only if the $k$th position of $n.b$ is $1$. Since the binary representation of $n$ has at most $\\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor+ 1$ digits, this also bounds the number of trees which can be used to represent $n$ nodes.\n\n\nc.\n Given a node $x$, let $x.key$, $x.p$, $x.c$, and $x.s$ represent the attributes key, parent, left-most child, and sibling to the right, respectively. The pointer attributes have value $\\text{NIL}$ when no such node exists. The root list will be stored in a singly linked list.\n\n\n\n\nMAKE-HEAP\n initialize an empty list for the root list and return a pointer to the head of the list, which contains $\\text{NIL}$. This takes constant time. To insert: Let $x$ be a node with key $k$, to be inserted. Scan the root list to find the first $m$ such that $B_m$ is not one of the trees in the binomial heap. If there is no $B_0$, simply create a single root node $x$. Otherwise, union $x, B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_{m - 1}$ into a $B_m$ tree. Remove all root nodes of the unioned trees from the root list, and update it with the new root. Since each join operation is logarithmic in the height of the tree, the total time is $O(\\lg n)$. $\\text{MINIMUM}$ just scans the root list and returns the minimum in $O(\\lg n)$, since the root list has size at most $O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nEXTRACT-MIN:\n finds and deletes the minimum, then splits the tree Bm which contained the minimum into its component binomial trees $B_0, B_1, \\ldots, B_{m - 1}$ in $O(\\lg n)$ time. Finally, it unions each of these with any existing trees of the same size in $O(\\lg n)$ time.\n\n\nUNION:\n suppose we have two binomial heaps consisting of trees $B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, \\ldots, B_{i_k}$ and $B_{j_1}, B_{j_2}, \\ldots, B_{j_m}$ respectively. Simply union  orresponding trees of the same size between the two heaps, then do another check and join any newly created trees which have caused additional duplicates. Note: we will perform at most one union on any fixed size of binomial tree so the total running time is still logarithmic in $n$, where we assume that $n$ is sum of the sizes of the trees which we are unioning.\n\n\nDECREASE-KEY:\n simply swap the node whose key was decreased up the tree until it satisfies the min-heap property.\n\n\nDELETE:\n note that every binomial tree consists of two copies of a smaller binomial tree, so we can write the procedure recursively. If the tree is a single node, simply delete it. If we wish to delete from $B_k$, first split the tree into its constituent copies of $B_{k - 1}$, and recursively call delete on the copy of $B_{k - 1}$ which contains $x$. If this results in two binomial trees of the same size, simply union them.\n\n\n\n\nd.\n The Fibonacci heap will look like a binomial heap, except that multiple copies of a given binomial tree will be allowed. Since the only trees which will appear are binomial trees and $B_k$ has $2k$ nodes, we must have $2k \\le n$, which implies $k \\le \\lfloor \\lg n \\rfloor$. Since the largest root of any binomial tree occurs at the root, and on $B_k$ it is degree $k$, this also bounds the largest degree of a node.\n\n\ne.\n $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{UNION}$ will no longer have amortized $O(1)$ running time because $\\text{CONSOLIDATE}$ has runtime $O(\\lg n)$. Even if no nodes are consolidated, the runtime is dominated by the check that all degrees are distinct. \n\n\nSince calling $\\text{UNION}$ on a heap and a single node is the same as insertion, it must also have runtime $O(\\lg n)$. The other operations remain unchanged.",

In this problem, we shall implement \n2-3-4 heaps\n, which support the mergeable-heap operations.\n\n\nThe 2-3-4 heaps differ from 2-3-4 trees in the following ways. In 2-3-4 heaps, only leaves store keys, and each leaf $x$ stores exactly one key in the attribute $x.key$. The keys in the leaves may appear in any order. Each internal node $x$ contains a value $x.small$ that is equal to the smallest key stored in any leaf in the subtree rooted at $x$. The root $r$ contains an attribute $r.height$ that gives the height of the tree. Finally, 2-3-4 heaps are designed to be kept in main memory, so that disk reads and writes are not needed.\n\n\nImplement the following 2-3-4 heap operations. In parts (a)\u2013(e), each operation should run in $O(\\lg n)$ time on a 2-3-4 heap with $n$ elements. The $\\text{UNION}$ operation in part (f) should run in $O(\\lg n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of elements in the two input heaps.\n\n\na.\n $\\text{MINIMUM}$, which returns a pointer to the leaf with the smallest key.\n\n\nb.\n $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$, which decreases the key of a given leaf $x$ to a given value $k \\le x.key$.\n\n\nc.\n $\\text{INSERT}$, which inserts leaf $x$ with key $k$.\n\n\nd.\n $\\text{DELETE}$, which deletes a given leaf $x$.\n\n\ne.\n $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$, which extracts the leaf with the smallest key.\n\n\nf.\n $\\text{UNION}$, which unites two 2-3-4 heaps, returning a single 2-3-4 heap and destroying the input heaps.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Traverse a path from root to leaf as follows: At a given node, examine the attribute $x.small$ in each child-node of the current node. Proceed to the child node which minimizes this attribute. If the children of the current node are leaves, then simply return a pointer to the child node with smallest key. Since the height of the tree is $O(\\lg n)$ and the number of children of any node is at most $4$, this has runtime $O(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nb.\n Decrease the key of $x$, then traverse the simple path from $x$ to the root by following the parent pointers. At each node $y$ encountered, check the attribute $y.small$. If $k < y.small$, set $y.small = k$. Otherwise do nothing and continue on the path.\n\n\nc.\n Insert works the same as in a B-tree, except that at each node it is assumed that the node to be inserted is 'smaller' than every key stored at that node, so the runtime is inherited. If the root is split, we update the height of the tree. When we reach the final node before the leaves, simply insert the new node as the leftmost child of that node.\n\n\nd.\n As with $\\text{B-TREE-DELETE}$, we'll want to ensure that the tree satisfies the properties of being a 2-3-4 tree after deletion, so we'll need to check that we're never deleting a leaf which only has a single sibling. This is handled in much the same way as in chapter 18. We can imagine that dummy keys are stored in all the internal nodes, and carry out the deletion process in exactly the same way as done in exercise 18.3-2, with the added requirement that we update the height stored in the root if we merge the root with its child nodes. \n\n\ne.\n $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ simply locates the minimum as done in part (a), then deletes it as in part (d).\n\n\nf.\n This can be done by implementing the join operation, as in Problem 18-2 (b).",

For the purpose of analysis, assume that $u^{1 / k}$ and $u^{1 - 1 / k}$ are always integers.\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the analysis of $\\text{(20.4)}$, we will analyze\n\n\n$$T(u) \\le T(u^{1 - 1 / k}) + T(u^{1 / k}) + O(1).$$\n\n\nThis is a good choice for analysis because for many operations we first check the summary vEB tree, which will have size $u^{1 / k}$ (the second term).

And then possible have to check a vEB tree somewhere in cluster, which will have size $u^{1 - 1/k}$ (the first term). We let $T(2^m) = S(m)$, so the equation becomes  $$S(m) \\le S(m(1 - 1/k)) + S(m/k) + O(1).$$  If $k > 2$ the first term dominates, so by master theorem, we'll have that $S(m)$ is $O(\\lg m)$, this means that T will be $O(\\lg(\\lg u))$ just as in the original case where we took squareroots.",

For simplicity, assume that $\\sqrt u$ is always an integer.\n\n\na.\n Explain why the following recurrence characterizes the space requirement $P(u)$ of a van Emde Boas tree with universe size $u$:\n\n\n$$P(u) = (\\sqrt u + 1) P(\\sqrt u) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u). \\tag{20.5}$$\n\n\nb.\n Prove that recurrence $\\text{(20.5)}$ has the solution $P(u) = O(u)$.\n\n\nIn order to reduce the space requirements, let us define a \nreduced-space van Emde Boas tree\n, or \nRS-vEB tree\n, as a vEB tree $V$ but with the following changes:\n\n\n\n\nThe attribute $V.cluster$, rather than being stored as a simple array of pointers to vEB trees with universe size $\\sqrt u$, is a hash table (see Chapter 11) stored as a dynamic table (see Section 17.4). Corresponding to the array version of $V.cluster$, the hash table stores pointers to RS-vEB trees with universe size $\\sqrt u$. To find the $i$th cluster, we look up the key $i$ in the hash table, so that we can find the $i$th cluster by a single search in the hash table.\n\n\nThe hash table stores only pointers to nonempty clusters. A search in the hash table for an empty cluster returns $\\text{NIL}$, indicating that the cluster is empty.\n\n\nThe attribute $V.summary$ is $\\text{NIL}$ if all clusters are empty. Otherwise, $V.summary$ points to an RS-vEB tree with universe size $\\sqrt u$.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the hash table is implemented with a dynamic table, the space it requires is proportional to the number of nonempty clusters.\n\n\nWhen we need to insert an element into an empty RS-vEB tree, we create the RS-vEB tree by calling the following procedure, where the parameter u is the universe size of the RS-vEB tree:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nCREATE\n-\nNEW\n-\nRS\n-\nVEB\n-\nTREE\n(\nu\n)\n\n    \nallocate\n \na\n \nnew\n \nvEB\n \ntree\n \nV\n\n    \nV\n.\nu\n \n=\n \nu\n\n    \nV\n.\nmin\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n    \nV\n.\nmax\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n    \nV\n.\nsummary\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n    \ncreate\n \nV\n.\ncluster\n \nas\n \nan\n \nempty\n \ndynamic\n \nhash\n \ntable\n\n    \nreturn\n \nV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc.\n Modify the $\\text{VEB-TREE-INSERT}$ procedure to produce pseudocode for the procedure $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-INSERT}(V, x)$, which inserts $x$ into the RS-vEB tree $V$, calling $\\text{CREATE-NEW-RS-VEB-TREE}$ as appropriate.\n\n\nd.\n Modify the $\\text{VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ procedure to produce pseudocode for the procedure $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}(V, x)$, which returns the successor of $x$ in RS-vEB tree $V$, or $\\text{NIL}$ if $x$ has no successor in $V$.\n\n\ne.\n Prove that, under the assumption of simple uniform hashing, your $\\text{RS-VEBTREE-INSERT}$ and $\\text{RS-VEB-TREE-SUCCESSOR}$ procedures run in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ expected time.\n\n\nf.\n Assuming that elements are never deleted from a vEB tree, prove that the space requirement for the RS-vEB tree structure is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements actually stored in the RS-vEB tree.\n\n\ng.\n RS-vEB trees have another advantage over vEB trees: they require less time to create. How long does it take to create an empty RS-vEB tree?\n\n\n\n\na.\n Lets look at what has to be stored for a vEB tree. Each vEB tree contains one vEB tree of size $\\sqrt[+]u$ and $\\sqrt[+]u$ vEB trees of size $\\sqrt[1]u$. It also is storing three numbers each of order $O(u)$, so they need $\\Theta(\\lg(u))$ space each. Lastly, it needs to store $\\sqrt u$ many pointers to the cluster vEB trees. We'll combine these last two contributions which are $\\Theta(\\lg(u))$ and $\\Theta(\\sqrt u)$ respectively into a single term that is $\\Theta(\\sqrt u)$. This gets us the recurrence\n\n\n$$P(u) = P(\\sqrt[+]u) + \\sqrt[+]u P(\\sqrt[-]u) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u).$$\n\n\nThen, we have that $u = 2^{2m}$ (which follows from the assumption that $\\sqrt u$ was an integer), this equation becomes\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(u) & = (1 + 2^m)P(2^m) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u) \\\\\n     & = (1 + \\sqrt u)P(\\sqrt u) + \\Theta(\\sqrt u)\n\\end{align}\n\n\nas desired.\n\n\nb.\n We recall from our solution to problem 3-6.e (it seems like so long ago now) that given a number $n$, a bound on the number of times that we need to take the squareroot of a number before it falls below $2$ is $\\lg\\lg n$. So, if we just unroll out recurrence, we get that\n\n\n$$P(u) \\le \\Big(\\prod_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u}(u^{1 / 2^i} + 1) \\Big) P(2) + \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u} \\Theta(u^{1 / 2^i})(u^{1 / 2i} + 1).$$\n\n\nThe first product has a highest power of $u$ corresponding to always multiplying the first terms of each binomial. The power in this term is equal to $\\sum_{i = 1}^{\\lg\\lg u}$ which is a partial sum of a geometric series whose sum is $1$. This means that the first term is $o(u)$. The order of the ith term in the summation appearing in the formula is $u^{2 / 2^i}$. In particular, for $i = 1$ is it $O(u)$, and for any $i > 1$, we have that $2 / 2^i < 1$, so those terms will be $o(u)$. Putting it all together, the largest term appearing is $O(u)$, and so, $P(u)$ is $O(u)$.\n\n\nc.\n For this problem we just use the version written for normal vEB trees, with minor modifications. That is, since there are entries in cluster that may not exist, and summary may of not yet been initialized, just before we try to access either, we check to see if it's initialized. If it isn't, we do so then.\n\n\nd.\n As in the previous problem, we just wait until just before either of the two things that may of not been allocated try to get used then allocate them if need be.\n\n\ne.\n Since the initialization performed only take constant time, those modifications don't ruin the the desired runtime bound for the original algorithms already had. So, our responses to parts (c) and (d) are $O(\\lg\\lg n)$.\n\n\nf.\n As mentioned in the errata, this part should instead be changed to $O(n\\lg n)$ space. When we are adding an element, we may have to add an entry to a dynamic hash table, which means that a constant amount of extra space would be needed. If we are adding an element to that table, we also have to add an element to the RS-vEB tree in the summary, but the entry that we add in the cluster will be a constant size RS-vEB tree. We can charge the cost of that addition to the summary table to the making the minimum element entry that we added in the cluster table. Since we are always making at least one element be added as a new min entry somewhere, this amortization will mean that it is only a constant amount of time in order to store the new entry.\n\n\ng.\n It only takes a constant amount of time to create an empty RS-vEB tree. This is immediate since the only dependence on $u$ in $\\text{CREATE-NEW-RSvEB-TREE}(u)$ is on line 2 when $V.u$ is initialized, but this only takes a constant amount of time. Since nothing else in the procedure depends on $u$, it must take a constant amount of time.",

            "text": "This problem investigates D. Willard's \"$y$-fast tries\" which, like van Emde Boas trees, perform each of the operations $\\text{MEMBER}$, $\\text{MINIMUM}$, $\\text{MAXIMUM}$, $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$, and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ on elements drawn from a universe with size $u$ in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ worst-case time. The $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations take $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ amortized time. Like reduced-space van Emde Boas trees (see Problem 20-1), $y$-fast tries use only $O(n)$ space to store $n$ elements. The design of $y$-fast tries relies on perfect hashing (see Section 11.5).\n\n\nAs a preliminary structure, suppose that we create a perfect hash table containing not only every element in the dynamic set, but every prefix of the binary representation of every element in the set. For example, if $u = 16$, so that $\\lg u = 4$, and $x = 13$ is in the set, then because the binary representation of $13$ is $1101$, the perfect hash table would contain the strings $1$, $11$, $110$, and $1101$. In addition to the hash table, we create a doubly linked list of the elements currently in the set, in increasing order.\n\n\na.\n How much space does this structure require?\n\n\nb.\n Show how to perform the $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ operations in $O(1)$ time; the $\\text{MEMBER}$, $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$, and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time; and the $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations in $O(\\lg u)$ time.\n\n\nTo reduce the space requirement to $O(n)$, we make the following changes to the data structure:\n\n\n\n\nWe cluster the $n$ elements into $n / \\lg u$ groups of size $\\lg u$. (Assume for now that $\\lg u$ divides $n$.) The first group consists of the $\\lg u$ smallest elements in the set, the second group consists of the next $\\lg u$ smallest elements, and so on.\n\n\nWe designate a \"representative\" value for each group. The representative of the $i$th group is at least as large as the largest element in the $i$th group, and it is smaller than every element of the $(i + 1)$st group. (The representative of the last group can be the maximum possible element $u - 1$.) Note that a representative might be a value not currently in the set.\n\n\nWe store the $\\lg u$ elements of each group in a balanced binary search tree, such as a red-black tree. Each representative points to the balanced binary search tree for its group, and each balanced binary search tree points to its group's representative.\n\n\n\n\nThe perfect hash table stores only the representatives, which are also stored in a doubly linked list in increasing order.\n\n\nWe call this structure a \n$y$-fast trie\n.\n\n\nc.\n Show that a $y$-fast trie requires only $O(n)$ space to store $n$ elements.\n\n\nd.\n Show how to perform the $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time with a $y$-fast trie.\n\n\ne.\n Show how to perform the $\\text{MEMBER}$ operation in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.\n\n\nf.\n Show how to perform the $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ operations in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.\n\n\ng.\n Explain why the $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ operations take $\\Omega(\\lg\\lg u)$ time.\n\n\nh.\n Show how to relax the requirement that each group in a $y$-fast trie has exactly $\\lg u$ elements to allow $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ to run in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ amortized time without affecting the asymptotic running times of the other operations.\n\n\n\n\na.\n By 11.5, the perfect hash table uses $O(m)$ space to store m elements. In a universe of size $u$, each element contributes $\\lg u$ entries to the hash table, so the requirement is $O(n\\lg u)$. Since the linked list requires $O(n)$, the total space requirement is $O(n\\lg u)$.\n\n\nb.\n $\\text{MINIMUM}$ and $\\text{MAXIMUM}$ are easy. We just examine the first and last elements of the associated doubly linked list. $\\text{MEMBER}$ can actually be performed in $O(1)$, since we are simply checking membership in a perfect hash table. $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ and $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ are a bit more complicated. \n\n\nAssume that we have a binary tree in which we store all the elements and their prefixes. When we query the hash table for an element, we get a pointer to that element's location in the binary search tree, if the element is in the tree, and $\\text{NIL}$ otherwise. Moreover, assume that every leaf node comes with a pointer to its position in the doubly linked list. Let $x$ be the number whose successor we seek. Begin by performing a binary search of the prefixes in the hash table to find the longest hashed prefix $y$ which matches a prefix of $x$. This takes $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ since we can check if any prefix is in the hash table in $O(1)$. \n\n\nObserve that $y$ can have at most one child in the BST, because if it had both children then one of these would share a longer prefix with $x$. If the left child is missing, have the left child pointer point to the largest labeled leaf node in the BST which is less than $y$. If the right child is missing, use its pointer to point to the successor of $y$. If $y$ is a leaf node then $y = x$, so we simply follow the pointer to $x$ in the doubly linked list, in $O(1)$, and its successor is the next element on the list. If $y$ is not a leaf node, we follow its predecessor or successor node, depending on which we need. This gives us $O(1)$ access to the proper element, so the total runtime is $O(\\lg\\lg u)$. $\\text{INSERT}$ and $\\text{DELETE}$ must take $O(\\lg u)$ since we need to insert one entry into the hash table for each of their bits and update the pointers.\n\n\nc.\n The doubly linked list has less than $n$ elements, while the binary search trees contains $n$ nodes, thus a $y$-fast trie requires $O(n)$ space.\n\n\nd.\n $\\text{MINIMUM}$: Find the minimum representative in the doubly linked list in $\\Theta(1)$, then find the minimum element in the binary search tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.\n\n\ne.\n Find the smallest representative greater than $k$ with binary searching in $\\Theta(\\lg\\lg u)$, find the element in the binary search tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.\n\n\nf.\n If we can find the largest representative greater than or equal to $x$, we can determine which binary tree contains the predecessor or successor of $x$. To do this, just call $\\text{PREDECESSOR}$ or $\\text{SUCCESSOR}$ on $x$ to locate the appropriate tree in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$. Since the tree has height $\\lg u$, we can find the predecessor or successor in $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.\n\n\ng.\n Same as \ne\n, we need to find the cluster in $\\Theta(\\lg\\lg u)$, then the operations in the binary search tree takes $O(\\lg\\lg u)$.\n\n\nh.\n We can relax the requirements and only impose the condition that each group has at least $\\frac{1}{2}\\lg u$ elements and at most $2\\lg u$ elements. \n\n\n\n\nIf a red-black tree is too big, we split it in half at the median. \n\n\nIf a red-black tree is too small, we merge it with a neighboring tree. \n\n\nIf this causes the merged tree to become too large, we split it at the median.\n\n\nIf a tree splits, we create a new representative. \n\n\nIf two trees merge, we delete the lost representative. \n\n\n\n\nAny split or merge takes $O(\\lg u)$ since we have to insert or delete an element in the data structure storing our representatives, which by part (b) takes $O(\\lg u)$. \n\n\nHowever, we only split a tree after at least $\\lg u$ insertions, since the size of one of the red-black trees needs to increase from $\\lg u$ to $2\\lg u$ and we only merge two trees after at least $(1 / 2)\\lg u$ deletions, because the size of the merging tree needs to have decreased from $\\lg u$ to $(1 / 2)\\lg u$. Thus, the amortized cost of the merges, splits, and updates to representatives is $O(1)$ per insertion or deletion, so the amortized cost is $O(\\lg\\lg u)$ as desired.",

Since every vertex starts off in its own set, some sequence of edges in $G$ must have resulted in eventually combining the sets containing $u$ and $v$.

When talking about the charge for each kind of operation, it is helpful to also be able to talk about the number of each kind of operation.\n\n\nConsider the usual sequence of $m$ $\\text{MAKE-SET}$, $\\text{UNION}$, and $\\text{FIND-SET}$ operations, $n$ of which are $\\text{MAKE-SET}$ operations, and let $l < n$ be the number of $\\text{UNION}$ operations. (Recall the discussion in Section 21.1 about there being at most $n - 1$ $\\text{UNION}$ operations.) Then there are $n$ $\\text{MAKE-SET}$ operations, $l$ $\\text{UNION}$ operations, and $m - n - l$ $\\text{FIND-SET}$ operations.\n\n\nThe theorem didn't separately name the number $l$ of $\\text{UNION}$s; rather, it bounded the number by $n$. If you go through the proof of the theorem with $l$ $\\text{UNION}$s, you get the time bound $O(m - l + l\\lg l) = O(m + l\\lg l)$ for the sequence of operations. That is, the actual time taken by the sequence of operations is at most $c(m + l\\lg l)$, for some constant $c$.\n\n\nThus, we want to assign operation charges such that\n\n\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\text{(MAKE-SET charge)} & \\cdot \\quad n \\\\\n+ \\text{(FIND-SET charge)} & \\cdot \\quad (m - n - l) \\\\\n+ \\text{(UNION charge)}    & \\cdot \\quad l \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ge c(m + l\\lg l),\n\\end{array}\n\n\nso that the amortized costs give an upper bound on the actual costs.\n\n\nThe following assignments work, where $c'$ is some constant $\\ge c$:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{MAKE-SET}$: $c'$\n\n\n$\\text{FIND-SET}$: $c'$\n\n\n$\\text{UNION}$: $c'(\\lg n + 1)$\n\n\n\n\nSubstituting into the above sum, we get\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nc'n + c'(m - n - l) + c'(\\lg n + 1)l \n    & = c'm + c'l\\lg n \\\\\n    & = c'(m + l\\lg n) \\\\\n    & > c(m + l\\lg l).\n\\end{align}\n\n\n21.2-4\n\n\n\n\nGive a tight asymptotic bound on the running time of the sequence of operations in Figure 21.3 assuming the linked-list representation and the weighted-union heuristic.\n\n\n\n\nWe call $\\text{MAKE-SET}$ $n$ times, which contributes $\\Theta(n)$. In each union, the smaller set is of size $1$, so each of these takes $\\Theta(1)$ time. Since we union $n - 1$ times, the runtime is $\\Theta(n)$.\n\n\n21.2-5\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gompers suspects that it might be possible to keep just one pointer in each set object, rather than two ($head$ and $tail$), while keeping the number of pointers in each list element at two. Show that the professor's suspicion is well founded by describing how to represent each set by a linked list such that each operation has the same running time as the operations described in this section. Describe also how the operations work. Your scheme should allow for the weighted-union heuristic, with the same effect as described in this section. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Use the tail of a linked list as its set's representative.)\n\n\n\n\nAs the hint suggests, make the representative of each set be the tail of its linked list. Except for the tail element, each element's representative pointer points to the tail. The tail's representative pointer points to the head. An element is the tail if its next pointer is $\\text{NIL}$. Now we can get to the tail in $O(1)$ time: if $x.next == \\text{NIL}$, then $tail = x$, else $tail = x.rep$. We can get to the head in $O(1)$ time as well: if $x.next == \\text{NIL}$, then $head = x.rep$, else $head = x.rep.rep$. The set object needs only to store a pointer to the tail, though a pointer to any list element would suffice.\n\n\n21.2-6\n\n\n\n\nSuggest a simple change to the $\\text{UNION}$ procedure for the linked-list representation that removes the need to keep the $tail$ pointer to the last object in each list. Whether or not the weighted-union heuristic is used, your change should not change the asymptotic running time of the $\\text{UNION}$ procedure. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Rather than appending one list to another, splice them together.)\n\n\n\n\nLet's call the two lists $A$ and $B$, and suppose that the representative of the new list will be the representative of $A$. Rather than appending $B$ to the end of $A$, instead splice $B$ into $A$ right after the first element of $A$. We have to traverse $B$ to update pointers to the set object anyway, so we can just make the last element of $B$ point to the second element of $A$.",

If you go through the proof of the theorem with $l$ $\\text{UNION}$s, you get the time bound $O(m - l + l\\lg l) = O(m + l\\lg l)$ for the sequence of operations. That is, the actual time taken by the sequence of operations is at most $c(m + l\\lg l)$, for some constant $c$.  Thus, we want to assign operation charges such that  \\begin{array}{ll}\n  \\text{(MAKE-SET charge)} & \\cdot \\quad n \\\\\n+ \\text{(FIND-SET charge)} & \\cdot \\quad (m - n - l) \\\\\n+ \\text{(UNION charge)}    & \\cdot \\quad l \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ge c(m + l\\lg l),\n\\end{array}  so that the amortized costs give an upper bound on the actual costs.  The following assignments work, where $c'$ is some constant $\\ge c$:   $\\text{MAKE-SET}$: $c'$  $\\text{FIND-SET}$: $c'$  $\\text{UNION}$: $c'(\\lg n + 1)$   Substituting into the above sum, we get  \\begin{align}\nc'n + c'(m - n - l) + c'(\\lg n + 1)l \n    & = c'm + c'l\\lg n \\\\\n    & = c'(m + l\\lg n) \\\\\n    & > c(m + l\\lg l).\n\\end{align}",

That is, if the simple path from $v$ to its root in $S_i$ is $v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k$, where $v_0 = v$ and $v_k$ is $S_i$'s root, then the depth of $v$ in $T_i$ is $\\sum_{j = 0}^k v_j.d$.\n\n\nb.\n Give an implementation of $\\text{MAKE-TREE}$.\n\n\nc.\n Show how to modify $\\text{FIND-SET}$ to implement $\\text{FIND-DEPTH}$.

It is similar to $\\text{FIND-SET}$ on page 571, but with three changes. First, when $v$ is either the root or a child of a root (one of these conditions holds if and only if $v.p = v.p.p$) in the disjoint-set forest, we don't have to recurse; instead, we just return $v.p$. Second, when we do recurse, we save the pointer $v.p$ into a new variable $y$. Third, when we recurse, we update $v.d$ by adding into it the $d$ values of all nodes on the find path that are no longer proper ancestors of $v$ after path compression; these nodes are precisely the proper ancestors of $v$ other than the root. Thus, as long as $v$ does not start out the $\\text{FIND-ROOT}$ call as either the root or a child of the root, we add $y.d$ into $v.d$. Note that $y.d$ has been updated prior to updating $v.d$, if $y$ is also neither the root nor a child of the root.\n\n\n$\\text{FIND-DEPTH}$ first calls $\\text{FIND-ROOT}$ to perform path compression and update pseudodistances. Afterward, the find path from $v$ consists of either just $v$ (if $v$ is a root) or just $v$ and $v.p$ (if $v$ is not a root, in which case it is a child of the root after path compression). In the former case, the depth of $v$ is just $v.d$, and in the latter case, the depth is $v.d + v.p.d$.\n\n\nd.\n Our procedure for $\\text{GRAFT}$ is a combination of $\\text{UNION}$ and $\\text{LINK}$:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nGRAPT\n(\nr\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n    \nr\n'\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nROOT\n(\nr\n)\n\n    \nv\n'\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nROOT\n(\nv\n)\n\n    \nz\n \n=\n \nFIND\n-\nDEPTH\n(\nv\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nr\n'\n.\nrank\n \n>\n \nv\n'\n.\nrank\n\n        \nv\n'\n.\np\n \n=\n \nr\n'\n\n        \nr\n'\n.\nd\n \n=\n \nr\n'\n.\nd\n \n+\n \nz\n \n+\n \n1\n\n        \nv\n'\n.\nd\n \n=\n \nv\n'\n.\nd\n \n-\n \nr\n'\n.\nd\n\n    \nelse\n \nr\n'\n.\np\n \n=\n \nv\n'\n\n        \nr\n'\n.\nd\n \n=\n \nr\n'\n.\nd\n \n+\n \nz\n \n+\n \n1\n \n-\n \nv\n'\n.\nd\n\n        \nif\n \nr\n'\n.\nrank\n \n==\n \nv\n'\n.\nrank\n\n            \nv\n'\n.\nrank\n \n=\n \nv\n'\n.\nrank\n \n+\n \n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis procedure works as follows. First, we call $\\text{FIND-ROOT}$ on $r$ and $v$ in order to find the roots $r'$ and $v'$, respectively, of their trees in the disjoint-set forest. As we saw in part (c), these $\\text{FIND-ROOT}$ calls also perform path compression and update pseudodistances on the find paths from $r$ and $v$. We then call $\\text{FIND-DEPTH}(v)$, saving the depth of $v$ in the variable $z$. (Since we have just compressed $v$'s find path, this call of $\\text{FIND-DEPTH}$ takes $\\text{O(1)}$ time.) Next, we emulate the action of $\\text{LINK}$, by making the root ($r'$ or $v'$) of smaller rank a child of the root of larger rank; in case of a tie, we make $r'$ a child of $v'$.\n\n\nIf $v'$ has the smaller rank, then all nodes in $r$'s tree will have their depths increased by the depth of $v$ plus $1$ (because $r$ is to become a child of $v$). Altering the psuedodistance of the root of a disjoint-set tree changes the computed depth of all nodes in that tree, and so adding $z + 1$ to $r'.d$ accomplishes this update for all nodes in $r$'s disjoint-set tree. Since $v'$ will become a child of $r'$ in the disjoint-set forest, we have just increased the computed depth of all nodes in the disjoint-set tree rooted at $v'$ by $r'.d$. These computed depths should not have changed, however. Thus, we subtract off $r'.d$ from $v'.d$, so that the sum $v'.d + r'.d$ after making $v'$ a child of $r'$ equals $v'.d$ before making $v'$ a child of $r'$.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if $r'$ has the smaller rank, or if the ranks are equal, then $r'$ becomes a child of $v'$ in the disjoint-set forest. In this case, $v'$ remains a root in the disjoint-set forest afterward, and we can leave $v'.d$ alone. We have to update $r'.d$, however, so that after making $r'$ a child of $v'$, the depth of each node in $r$'s disjoint-set tree is increased by $z + 1$. We add $z + 1$ to $r'.d$, but we also subtract out $v'.d$, since we have just made $r'$ a child of $v'$. Finally, if the ranks of $r'$ and $v'$ are equal, we increment the rank of $v'$, as is done in the $\\text{LINK}$ procedure.\n\n\ne.\n The asymptotic running times of $\\text{MAKE-TREE}$, $\\text{FIND-DEPTH}$, and $\\text{GRAFT}$ are equivalent to those of $\\text{MAKE-SET}$, $\\text{FIND-SET}$, and $\\text{UNION}$, respectively.

Then, when we are running line 7 of $\\text{LCA}(u)$, we immediately go on to the \nfor\n loop on line 8.\n\n\nSo, while we are doing this \nfor\n loop, we still haven't called line 7 of $\\text{LCA}(v)$. This means that $v.color$ is white, and so, the pair ${u, v}$ is not considered during the run of $\\text{LCA}(u)$. However, during the \nfor\n loop of $\\text{LCA}(v)$, since line 7 of $\\text{LCA}(u)$ has already run, $u.color = black$. This means that we will consider the pair ${u, v}$ during the running of $\\text{LCA}(v)$.\n\n\nIt is not obvious what the ordering $\\le_{LCA}$ is, as it will be implementation dependent. It depends on the order in which child vertices are iterated in the \nfor\n loop on line 3. That is, it doesn't just depend on the graph structure.\n\n\nb.\n We suppose that it is true prior to a given call of $\\text{LCA}$, and show that this property is preserved throughout a run of the procedure, increasing the number of disjoint sets by one by the end of the procedure. So, supposing that $u$ has depth $d$ and there are $d$ items in the disjoint set data structure before it runs, it increases to $d + 1$ disjoint sets on line 1. So, by the time we get to line 4, and call $\\text{LCA}$ of a child of $u$, there are $d + 1$ disjoint sets, this is exactly the depth of the child. After line 4, there are now $d + 2$ disjoint sets, so, line 5 brings it back down to $d + 1$ disjoint sets for the subsequent times through the loop. After the loop, there are no more changes to the number of disjoint sets, so, the algorithm terminates with $\\text{d + 1}$ disjoint sets, as desired. Since this holds for any arbitrary run of $\\text{LCA}$, it holds for all runs of $\\text{LCA}$.\n\n\nc.\n Suppose that the pair $u$ and $v$ have the least common ancestor $w$. Then, when running $\\text{LCA}(w)$, $u$ will be in the subtree rooted at one of $w$'s children, and $v$ will be in another. WLOG, suppose that the subtree containing $u$ runs first.\n\n\nSo, when we are done with running that subtree, all of their ancestor values will point to $w$ and their colors will be black, and their ancestor values will not change until $\\text{LCA}(w)$ returns. However, we run $\\text{LCA}(v)$ before $\\text{LCA}(w)$ returns, so in the \nfor\n loop on line 8 of $\\text{LCA}(v)$, we will be considering the pair ${u, v}$, since $u.color = black$. Since $u.ancestor$ is still $w$, that is what will be output, which is the correct answer for their $\\text{LCA}$.\n\n\nd.\n The time complexity of lines 1 and 2 are just constant. Then, for each child, we have a call to the same procedure, a $\\text{UNION}$ operation which only takes constant time, and a $\\text{FIND-SET}$ operation which can take at most amortized inverse Ackerman's time. Since we check each and every thing that is adjacent to $u$ for being black, we are only checking each pair in $P$ at most twice in lines 8-10, among all the runs of $\\text{LCA}$. This means that the total runtime is $O(|T|\\alpha(|T|) + |P|)$.",

Show how to determine whether a directed graph $G$ contains a \nuniversal sink\n $-$ a vertex with $\\text{in-degree}$ $|V| - 1$ and $\\text{out-degree}$ $0$ $-$ in time $O(V)$, given an adjacency matrix for $G$.\n\n\n\n\nWe start by observing that if $a_{ij} = 1$, so that $(i, j) \\in E$, then vertex $i$ cannot be a universal sink, for it has an outgoing edge. Thus, if row $i$ contains a $1$, then vertex $i$ cannot be a universal sink. This observation also means that if there is a $\\text{self-loop}(i, i)$, then vertex $i$ is not a universal sink. Now suppose that $a_{ij} = 0$, so that $(i, j) \\notin E$, and also that $i \\ne j$. Then vertex $j$ cannot be a universal sink, for either its $\\text{in-degree}$ must be strictly less than $|V| - 1$ or it has a self-loop. Thus if column $j$ contains a $0$ in any position other than the diagonal entry $(j, j)$, then vertex $j$ cannot be a universal sink.\n\n\nUsing the above observations, the following procedure returns $\\text{TRUE}$ if vertex $k$ is a universal sink, and $\\text{FALSE}$ otherwise.

This property holds because if vertex $j$ is a universal sink, then we would have $(i, j) \\in E$ for all $i \\ne j$ and so no other vertex $i$ could be a universal sink.\n\n\nThe following procedure takes an adjacency matrix $A$ as input and returns either a message that there is no universal sink or a message containing the identity of the universal sink.

It stops once either $i$ or $j$ exceeds $|V|$.\n\n\nTo understand why $\\text{UNIVERSAL-SINK}$ works, we need to show that after the \nwhile\n loop terminates, the only vertex that might be a universal sink is vertex $i$. The call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$ then determines whether vertex $i$ is indeed a universal sink.\n\n\nLet us fix $i$ and $j$ to be values of these variables at the termination of the \nwhile\n loop. We claim that every vertex $k$ such that $1 \\le k < i$ cannot be a universal sink. That is because the way that $i$ achieved its final value at loop termination was by finding a $1$ in each row $k$ for which $1 \\le k < i$. As we observed above, any vertex $k$ whose row contains a $1$ cannot be a universal sink.\n\n\nIf $i > |V|$ at loop termination, then we have eliminated all vertices from consid- eration, and so there is no universal sink. If, on the other hand, $i \\le |V|$ at loop termination, we need to show that every vertex $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ cannot be a universal sink. If $i \\le |V|$ at loop termination, then the \nwhile\n loop terminated because $j > |V|$. That means that we found a $0$ in every column. Recall our earlier observation that if column $k$ contains a $0$ in an off-diagonal position, then vertex $k$ cannot be a universal sink. Since we found a $0$ in every column, we found a $0$ in every column $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$. Moreover, we never examined any matrix entries in rows greater than $i$, and so we never examined the diagonal entry in any column $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$. Therefore, all the $0$s that we found in columns $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ were off-diagonal. We conclude that every vertex $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ cannot be a universal sink.\n\n\nThus, we have shown that every vertex less than $i$ and every vertex greater than $i$ cannot be a universal sink. The only remaining possibility is that vertex $i$ might be a universal sink, and the call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$ checks whether it is.\n\n\nTo see that $\\text{UNIVERSAL-SINK}$ runs in $O(V)$ time, observe that either $i$ or $j$ is incremented in each iteration of the \nwhile\n loop. Thus, the \nwhile\n loop makes at most $2|V| - 1$ iterations. Each iteration takes $O(1)$ time, for a total \nwhile\n loop time of $O(V)$ and, combined with the $O(V)$-time call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$, we get a total running time of $O(V)$.\n\n\n22.1-7\n\n\n\n\nThe \nincidence matrix\n of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with no self-loops is a $|V| \\times |E|$ matrix $B = (b_{ij})$ such that\n\n\n$$\nb_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n-1 & \\text{if edge $j$ leaves vertex $i$}, \\\\\n 1 & \\text{if edge $j$ enters vertex $i$}, \\\\\n 0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nDescribe what the entries of the matrix product $BB^\\text T$ represent, where $B^\\text T$ is the transpose of $B$.\n\n\n\n\n$$BB^\\text T(i, j) = \\sum\\limits_{e\\in E}b_{ie} b_{ej}^\\text T = \\sum\\limits_{e\\in E}b_{ie}b_{je}.$$\n\n\n\n\nIf $i = j$, then $b_{ie} b_{je} = 1$ (it is $1 \\cdot 1$ or $(-1) \\cdot (-1)$) whenever $e$ enters or leaves vertex $i$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n\nIf $i \\ne j$, then $b_{ie} b_{je} = -1$ when $e = (i, j)$ or $e = (j, i)$, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nThus,\n\n\n$$\nBB^\\text T(i, j) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{degree of $i$ = in-degree + out-degree}   & \\text{if $i = j$}, \\\\\n\\text{$-$(# of edges connecting $i$ and $j$)}  & \\text{if $i \\ne j$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n22.1-8\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry $Adj[u]$ is a hash table containing the vertices $v$ for which $(u, v) \\in E$.

            "text": "Most graph algorithms that take an adjacency-matrix representation as input require time $\\Omega(V^2)$, but there are some exceptions. Show how to determine whether a directed graph $G$ contains a  universal sink  $-$ a vertex with $\\text{in-degree}$ $|V| - 1$ and $\\text{out-degree}$ $0$ $-$ in time $O(V)$, given an adjacency matrix for $G$.   We start by observing that if $a_{ij} = 1$, so that $(i, j) \\in E$, then vertex $i$ cannot be a universal sink, for it has an outgoing edge. Thus, if row $i$ contains a $1$, then vertex $i$ cannot be a universal sink. This observation also means that if there is a $\\text{self-loop}(i, i)$, then vertex $i$ is not a universal sink. Now suppose that $a_{ij} = 0$, so that $(i, j) \\notin E$, and also that $i \\ne j$. Then vertex $j$ cannot be a universal sink, for either its $\\text{in-degree}$ must be strictly less than $|V| - 1$ or it has a self-loop. Thus if column $j$ contains a $0$ in any position other than the diagonal entry $(j, j)$, then vertex $j$ cannot be a universal sink.  Using the above observations, the following procedure returns $\\text{TRUE}$ if vertex $k$ is a universal sink, and $\\text{FALSE}$ otherwise. It takes as input a $|V| \\times |V|$ adjacency matrix $A = (a_{ij})$.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 IS - SINK ( A ,   k ) \n     let   A   be   | V |   \u00d7   | V | \n     for   j   =   1   to   | V |        // Check for a 1 in row k \n         if   a [ k ][ j ]   ==   1 \n             return   FALSE \n     for   i   =   1   to   | V |        // Check for an off-diagonal 0 in column k \n         if   a [ i ][ k ]   ==   0   and   i   !=   k \n             return   FALSE \n     return   TRUE    Because this procedure runs in $O(V)$ time, we may call it only $O(1)$ times in order to achieve our $O(V)$-time bound for determining whether directed graph $G$ contains a universal sink.  Observe also that a directed graph can have at most one universal sink. This property holds because if vertex $j$ is a universal sink, then we would have $(i, j) \\in E$ for all $i \\ne j$ and so no other vertex $i$ could be a universal sink.  The following procedure takes an adjacency matrix $A$ as input and returns either a message that there is no universal sink or a message containing the identity of the universal sink. It works by eliminating all but one vertex as a potential universal sink and then checking the remaining candidate vertex by a single call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13 UNIVERSAL - SINK ( A ) \n     let   A   be   | V |   \u00d7   | V | \n     i   =   j   =   1 \n     while   i   \u2264   | V |   and   j   \u2264   | V | \n         if   a [ i ][ j ]   ==   1 \n             i   =   i   +   1 \n         else   j   =   j   +   1 \n     s   =   0 \n     if   i   >   | V | \n         return   \"there is no universal sink\" \n     else   if   IS - SINK ( A ,   i )   =   FALSE \n         return   \"there is no universal sink\" \n     else   return   i   \"is a universal sink\"    $\\text{UNIVERSAL-SINK}$ walks through the adjacency matrix, starting at the upper left corner and always moving either right or down by one position, depending on whether the current entry $a_{ij}$ it is examining is $0$ or $1$. It stops once either $i$ or $j$ exceeds $|V|$.  To understand why $\\text{UNIVERSAL-SINK}$ works, we need to show that after the  while  loop terminates, the only vertex that might be a universal sink is vertex $i$. The call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$ then determines whether vertex $i$ is indeed a universal sink.  Let us fix $i$ and $j$ to be values of these variables at the termination of the  while  loop. We claim that every vertex $k$ such that $1 \\le k < i$ cannot be a universal sink. That is because the way that $i$ achieved its final value at loop termination was by finding a $1$ in each row $k$ for which $1 \\le k < i$. As we observed above, any vertex $k$ whose row contains a $1$ cannot be a universal sink.  If $i > |V|$ at loop termination, then we have eliminated all vertices from consid- eration, and so there is no universal sink. If, on the other hand, $i \\le |V|$ at loop termination, we need to show that every vertex $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ cannot be a universal sink. If $i \\le |V|$ at loop termination, then the  while  loop terminated because $j > |V|$. That means that we found a $0$ in every column. Recall our earlier observation that if column $k$ contains a $0$ in an off-diagonal position, then vertex $k$ cannot be a universal sink. Since we found a $0$ in every column, we found a $0$ in every column $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$. Moreover, we never examined any matrix entries in rows greater than $i$, and so we never examined the diagonal entry in any column $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$. Therefore, all the $0$s that we found in columns $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ were off-diagonal. We conclude that every vertex $k$ such that $i < k \\le |V|$ cannot be a universal sink.  Thus, we have shown that every vertex less than $i$ and every vertex greater than $i$ cannot be a universal sink. The only remaining possibility is that vertex $i$ might be a universal sink, and the call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$ checks whether it is.  To see that $\\text{UNIVERSAL-SINK}$ runs in $O(V)$ time, observe that either $i$ or $j$ is incremented in each iteration of the  while  loop. Thus, the  while  loop makes at most $2|V| - 1$ iterations. Each iteration takes $O(1)$ time, for a total  while  loop time of $O(V)$ and, combined with the $O(V)$-time call to $\\text{IS-SINK}$, we get a total running time of $O(V)$.",

Let $s$ be any vertex in $T$. We claim that the result of a single $\\text{BFS}$ will return either $a$ or $b$ (or both) as the vertex whose distance from $s$ is greatest.\n\n\nTo see this, suppose to the contrary that some other vertex $x$ is shown to be furthest from $s$.

If not, then by the triangle inequality we must have a strict less-than. In other words, there is some path from $x$ to $b$ which does not go through $c$. This gives the contradiction, because it implies there is a cycle formed by concatenating these paths. Then we have\n\n\n$$d(a, b) < d(a, b) + 2d(s, c) < d(x, b).$$\n\n\nSince it is assumed that $d(a, b)$ is maximal among all pairs, we have a contradiction. Therefore, since trees have $|V| - 1$ edges, we can run $\\text{BFS}$ a single time in $O(V)$ to obtain one of the vertices which is the endpoint of the longest simple path contained in the graph. Running $\\text{BFS}$ again will show us where the other one is, so we can solve the diameter problem for trees in $O(V)$.\n\n\n22.2-9\n\n\n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a connected, undirected graph.

Give an efficient algorithm to compute the diameter of a tree, and analyze the running time of your algorithm.   Suppose that a and b are the endpoints of the path in the tree which achieve the diameter, and without loss of generality assume that $a$ and $b$ are the unique pair which do so. Let $s$ be any vertex in $T$. We claim that the result of a single $\\text{BFS}$ will return either $a$ or $b$ (or both) as the vertex whose distance from $s$ is greatest.  To see this, suppose to the contrary that some other vertex $x$ is shown to be furthest from $s$. (Note that $x$ cannot be on the path from $a$ to $b$, otherwise we could extend). Then we have  $$d(s, a) < d(s, x)$$  and  $$d(s, b) < d(s, x).$$  Let $c$ denote the vertex on the path from $a$ to $b$ which minimizes $d(s, c)$. Since the graph is in fact a tree, we must have  $$d(s, a) = d(s, c) + d(c, a)$$  and  $$d(s, b) = d(s, c) + d(c, b).$$  (If there were another path, we could form a cycle). Using the triangle inequality and inequalities and equalities mentioned above we must have  \\begin{align}\nd(a, b) + 2d(s, c) & = d(s, c) + d(c, b) + d(s, c) + d(c, a) \\\\\n                   & < d(s, x) + d(s, c) + d(c, b).\n\\end{align}  I claim that $d(x, b) = d(s, c) + d(s, b)$. If not, then by the triangle inequality we must have a strict less-than. In other words, there is some path from $x$ to $b$ which does not go through $c$. This gives the contradiction, because it implies there is a cycle formed by concatenating these paths. Then we have  $$d(a, b) < d(a, b) + 2d(s, c) < d(x, b).$$  Since it is assumed that $d(a, b)$ is maximal among all pairs, we have a contradiction. Therefore, since trees have $|V| - 1$ edges, we can run $\\text{BFS}$ a single time in $O(V)$ to obtain one of the vertices which is the endpoint of the longest simple path contained in the graph. Running $\\text{BFS}$ again will show us where the other one is, so we can solve the diameter problem for trees in $O(V)$.",

This solution reflects the change.\n\n\nThe $\\text{DFS}$ and $\\text{DFS-VISIT}$ procedures care only whether a vertex is white or not. By coloring vertex $u$ gray when it is first visited, in line 3 of $\\text{DFS-VISIT}$, we ensure that $u$ will not be visited again.

(If $(u, v)$ is a back edge, then $u$ is a descendant of $v$, and if $(u, v)$ is a cross edge, then neither of $u$ or $v$ is a descendant of the other.) By Corollary 22.8, therefore, $(u, v)$ is a tree edge or forward edge if and only if $u.d < v.d < v.f < u.f$.\n\n\nb.\n First, suppose that $(u, v)$ is a back edge. A self-loop is by definition a back edge. If $(u, v)$ is a self-loop, then clearly $v.d = u.d < u.f = v.f$. If $(u, v)$ is not a self-loop, then $u$ is a descendant of $v$ in the depth-first forest, and by Corollary 22.8, $v.d < u.d < u.f < v.f$.\n\n\nNow, suppose that $v.d \\le u.d < u.f \\le v.f$. If $u$ and $v$ are the same vertex, then $v.d = u.d < u.f = v.f$, and $(u, v)$ is a self-loop and hence a back edge. If $u$ and $v$ are distinct, then $v.d < u.d < u.f < v.f$. By the parenthesis theorem, interval $[u.d, u.f]$ is contained entirely within the interval $[v.d, v.f]$, and $u$ is a descendant of $v$ in a depth-first tree. Thus, $(u, v)$ is a back edge.\n\n\nc.\n First, suppose that $(u, v)$ is a cross edge. Since neither $u$ nor $v$ is an ancestor of the other, the parenthesis theorem says that the intervals $[u.d, u.f]$ and $[v.d, v.f]$ are entirely disjoint. Thus, we must have either $u.d < u.f < v.d < v.f$ or $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$. We claim that we cannot have $u.d < v.d$ if $(u, v)$ is a cross edge. Why? If $u.d < v.d$, then $v$ is white at time $u.d$. By the white-path theorem, $v$ is a descendant of $u$, which contradicts $(u, v)$ being a cross edge. Thus, we must have $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$.\n\n\nNow suppose that $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$. By the parenthesis theorem, neither $u$ nor $v$ is a descendant of the other, which means that $(u, v)$ must be a cross edge.\n\n\n22.3-6\n\n\n\n\nShow that in an undirected graph, classifying an edge $(u, v)$ as a tree edge or a back edge according to whether $(u, v)$ or $(v, u)$ is encountered first during the depth-first search is equivalent to classifying it according to the ordering of the four types in the classification scheme.\n\n\n\n\nBy Theorem 22.10, every edge of an undirected graph is either a tree edge or a back edge. First suppose that $v$ is first discovered by exploring edge $(u, v)$. Then by definition, $(u, v)$ is a tree edge. Moreover, $(u, v)$ must have been discovered before $(v, u)$ because once $(v, u)$ is explored, $v$ is necessarily discovered. Now suppose that $v$ isn't first discovered by $(u, v)$. Then it must be discovered by $(r, v)$ for some $r\\ne u$. If $u$ hasn't yet been discovered then if $(u, v)$ is explored first, it must be a back edge since $v$ is an ancestor of $u$. If $u$ has been discovered then $u$ is an ancestor of $v$, so $(v, u)$ is a back edge.\n\n\n22.3-7\n\n\n\n\nRewrite the procedure $\\text{DFS}$, using a stack to eliminate recursion.\n\n\n\n\nSee the algorithm $\\text{DFS-STACK}(G)$.

Edge $(u, v)$ is a tree edge or forward edge if and only if $v$ is a descendant of $u$ in the depth-first forest. (If $(u, v)$ is a back edge, then $u$ is a descendant of $v$, and if $(u, v)$ is a cross edge, then neither of $u$ or $v$ is a descendant of the other.) By Corollary 22.8, therefore, $(u, v)$ is a tree edge or forward edge if and only if $u.d < v.d < v.f < u.f$.  b.  First, suppose that $(u, v)$ is a back edge. A self-loop is by definition a back edge. If $(u, v)$ is a self-loop, then clearly $v.d = u.d < u.f = v.f$. If $(u, v)$ is not a self-loop, then $u$ is a descendant of $v$ in the depth-first forest, and by Corollary 22.8, $v.d < u.d < u.f < v.f$.  Now, suppose that $v.d \\le u.d < u.f \\le v.f$. If $u$ and $v$ are the same vertex, then $v.d = u.d < u.f = v.f$, and $(u, v)$ is a self-loop and hence a back edge. If $u$ and $v$ are distinct, then $v.d < u.d < u.f < v.f$. By the parenthesis theorem, interval $[u.d, u.f]$ is contained entirely within the interval $[v.d, v.f]$, and $u$ is a descendant of $v$ in a depth-first tree. Thus, $(u, v)$ is a back edge.  c.  First, suppose that $(u, v)$ is a cross edge. Since neither $u$ nor $v$ is an ancestor of the other, the parenthesis theorem says that the intervals $[u.d, u.f]$ and $[v.d, v.f]$ are entirely disjoint. Thus, we must have either $u.d < u.f < v.d < v.f$ or $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$. We claim that we cannot have $u.d < v.d$ if $(u, v)$ is a cross edge. Why? If $u.d < v.d$, then $v$ is white at time $u.d$. By the white-path theorem, $v$ is a descendant of $u$, which contradicts $(u, v)$ being a cross edge. Thus, we must have $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$.  Now suppose that $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$. By the parenthesis theorem, neither $u$ nor $v$ is a descendant of the other, which means that $(u, v)$ must be a cross edge.",

By Theorem 22.10, every edge of an undirected graph is either a tree edge or a back edge. First suppose that $v$ is first discovered by exploring edge $(u, v)$. Then by definition, $(u, v)$ is a tree edge. Moreover, $(u, v)$ must have been discovered before $(v, u)$ because once $(v, u)$ is explored, $v$ is necessarily discovered.

We do not need to actually remove the edges from the adjacency list, because that adjacency list will never be processed again by the algorithm: Each vertex is enqueued/dequeued at most once because it is enqueued only if it starts out with $\\text{in-degree}$ $0$ or if its indegree becomes $0$ after being decremented (and never incremented) some number of times.\n\n\n\n\nThe processing of a vertex from the queue happens $O(V)$ times because no vertex can be enqueued more than once.

Vertex $v_0$ cannot start out with $\\text{in-degree}$ $0$ (or it would be output), so there are edges into $v_0$. Since $v_0$'s $\\text{in-degree}$ never becomes $0$, at least one edge $(v_1, v_0)$ is never removed, which means that at least one other vertex $v_1$ was not output. Similarly, $v_1$ not output means that some vertex $v_2$ such that $(v_2, v_1) \\in E$ was not output, and so on. Since the number of vertices is finite, this path ($\\cdots \\to v_2 \\to v_1 \\to v_0$) is finite, so we must have $v_i = v_j$ for some $i$ and $j$ in this sequence, which means there is a cycle.\n\n\n\n\nIf there are cycles, not all vertices will be output, because some $\\text{in-degree}$s never become $0$.\n\n\n\n\nProof: Assume that a vertex in a cycle is output (its $\\text{in-degree}$ becomes $0$). Let $v$ be the first vertex in its cycle to be output, and let $u$ be $v$'s predecessor in the cycle. In order for $v$'s $\\text{in-degree}$ to become $0$, the edge $(u, v)$ must have been ''removed,'' which happens only when $u$ is processed. But this cannot have happened, because $v$ is the first vertex in its cycle to be processed. Thus no vertices in cycles are output.",

If there are no cycles, all vertices are output.   Proof: Assume that some vertex $v_0$ is not output. Vertex $v_0$ cannot start out with $\\text{in-degree}$ $0$ (or it would be output), so there are edges into $v_0$. Since $v_0$'s $\\text{in-degree}$ never becomes $0$, at least one edge $(v_1, v_0)$ is never removed, which means that at least one other vertex $v_1$ was not output.

To see that it is possible to stay the same, just suppose you add some edge to a cycle. To see that it is possible to decrease, suppose that your original graph is on three vertices, and is just a path passing through all of them, and the edge added completes this path to a cycle. To see that it cannot increase, notice that adding an edge cannot remove any path that existed before. \n\n\nSo, if $u$ and $v$ are in the same connected component in the original graph, then there are a path from one to the other, in both directions. Adding an edge wont disturb these two paths, so we know that $u$ and $v$ will still be in the same $\\text{SCC}$ in the graph after adding the edge. Since no components can be split apart, this means that the number of them cannot increase since they form a partition of the set of vertices.\n\n\n22.5-2\n\n\n\n\nShow how the procedure $\\text{STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS}$ works on the graph of Figure 22.6.

Assume that the loop of lines 5\u20137 of $\\text{DFS}$ considers vertices in alphabetical order and that the adjacency lists are in alphabetical order.\n\n\n\n\nThe finishing times of each vertex were computed in exercise 22.3-2. The forest consists of 5 trees, each of which is a chain. We'll list the vertices of each tree in order from root to leaf: $r$, $u$, $q - y - t$, $x - z$, and $s - w - v$.\n\n\n22.5-3\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Bacon claims that the algorithm for strongly connected components would be simpler if it used the original (instead of the transpose) graph in the second depth-first search and scanned the vertices in order of \nincreasing\n finishing times. Does this simpler algorithm always produce correct results?\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Bacon's suggestion doesn't work out. As an example, suppose that our graph is on the three vertices $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and consists of the edges $(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2)$. Then, we should end up with $\\{2, 3\\}$ and $\\{1\\}$ as our $\\text{SCC}$'s. However, a possible $\\text{DFS}$ starting at $2$ could explore $3$ before $1$, this would mean that the finish time of $3$ is lower than of $1$ and $2$. This means that when we first perform the $\\text{DFS}$ starting at $3$. However, a $\\text{DFS}$ starting at $3$ will be able to reach all other vertices. This means that the algorithm would return that the entire graph is a single $\\text{SCC}$, even though this is clearly not the case since there is neither a path from $1$ to $2$ of from $1$ to $3$.\n\n\n22.5-4\n\n\n\n\nProve that for any directed graph $G$, we have $((G^\\text T)^{\\text{SCC}})^\\text T = G^{\\text{SCC}}$. That is, the transpose of the component graph of $G^\\text T$ is the same as the component graph of $G$.\n\n\n\n\nFirst observe that $C$ is a strongly connected component of $G$ if and only if it is a strongly connected component of $G^\\text T$. Thus the vertex sets of $G^{\\text{SCC}}$ and $(G^\\text T)^{\\text{SCC}}$ are the same, which implies the vertex sets of $((G^\\text T)^\\text{SCC})^\\text T$ and $G^{\\text{SCC}}$ are the same. It suffices to show that their edge sets are the same. Suppose $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge in $((G^\\text T)^{\\text{SCC}})^\\text T$. Then $(v_j, v_i)$ is an edge in $(G^\\text T)^{\\text{SCC}}$. Thus there exist $x \\in C_j$ and $y \\in C_i$ such that $(x, y)$ is an edge of $G^\\text T$, which implies $(y, x)$ is an edge of $G$. Since components are preserved, this means that $(v_i, v_j)$ is an edge in $G^{\\text{SCC}}$. For the opposite implication we simply note that for any graph $G$ we have $(G^\\text T)^{\\text T} = G$.\n\n\n22.5-5\n\n\n\n\nGive an $O(V + E)$-time algorithm to compute the component graph of a directed graph $G = (V, E)$. Make sure that there is at most one edge between two vertices in the component graph your algorithm produces.\n\n\n\n\nWe have at our disposal an $O(V + E)$-time algorithm that computes strongly connected components. Let us assume that the output of this algorithm is a mapping $u.scc$, giving the number of the strongly connected component containing vertex $u$, for each vertex $u$. Without loss of generality, assume that $u.scc$ is an integer in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, |V|\\}$.\n\n\nConstruct the multiset (a set that can contain the same object more than once) $T = \\{u.scc: u \\in V\\}$, and sort it by using counting sort. Since the values we are sorting are integers in the range $1$ to $|V|$, the time to sort is $O(V)$. Go through the sorted multiset $T$ and every time we find an element $x$ that is distinct from the one before it, add $x$ to $V^{\\text{SCC}}$. (Consider the first element of the sorted set as ''distinct from the one before it.'') It takes $O(V)$ time to construct $V^{\\text{SCC}}$.\n\n\nConstruct the set of ordered pairs\n\n\n$$\\text{$(x, y)$: there is an edge $(u, v) \\in E$, $x = u.scc$, and $y = v.scc$}.$$\n\n\nWe can easily construct this set in $\\Theta(E)$ time by going through all edges in $E$ and looking up $u.scc$ and $v.scc$ for each edge $(u, v) \\in E$.\n\n\nHaving constructed $S$, remove all elements of the form $(x, x)$.

Assuming that $G$ contains $k$ $\\text{SCC}$'s, the topological sort gives a linear ordering $\\langle v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k \\rangle$ of the vertices.\n\n\nVerify that the sequence of vertices $\\langle v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k \\rangle$ given by topological sort forms a linear chain in the component graph. That is, verify that the edges $(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), \\ldots, (v_{k - 1}, v_k)$ exist in the component graph. If the vertices form a linear chain, then the original graph is semiconnected; otherwise it is not.\n\n\n\n\nBecause we know that all vertices in each $\\text{SCC}$ are mutually reachable from each other, it suffices to show that the component graph is semiconnected if and only if it contains a linear chain. We must also show that if there's a linear chain in the component graph, it's the one returned by topological sort.\n\n\nWe'll first show that if there's a linear chain in the component graph, then it's the one returned by topological sort. In fact, this is trivial. A topological sort has to respect every edge in the graph. So if there's a linear chain, a topological sort \nmust\n give us the vertices in order.\n\n\nNow we'll show that the component graph is semiconnected if and only if it contains a linear chain.\n\n\nFirst, suppose that the component graph contains a linear chain. Then for every pair of vertices $u$, $v$ in the component graph, there is a path between them. If $u$ precedes $v$ in the linear chain, then there's a path $u \\leadsto v$. Otherwise, $v$ precedes $u$, and there's a path $v \\leadsto u$.\n\n\nConversely, suppose that the component graph does not contain a linear chain. Then in the list returned by topological sort, there are two consecutive vertices $v_i$ and $v_{i + 1}$, but the edge$(v_i, v_{i + 1})$ is not in the component graph. Any edges out of $v_i$ are to vertices $v_j$, where $j > i + 1$, and so there is no path from $v_i$ to $v_{i + 1}$ in the component graph. And since $v_{i + 1}$ follows $v_i$ in the topological sort, there cannot be any paths at all from $v_{i + 1}$ to $v_i$. Thus, the component graph is not semiconnected.\n\n\nRunning time of each step:\n\n\n\n\n$\\Theta(V + E)$.\n\n\n$O(V + E)$.\n\n\nSince the component graph has at most $|V|$ vertices and at most $|E|$ edges, $O(V + E)$.\n\n\nAlso $O(V + E)$. We just check the adjacency list of each vertex $v_i$ in the component graph to verify that there's an edge $(v_i, v_{i + 1})$. We'll go through each adjacency list once.\n\n\n\n\nThus, the total running time is $\\Theta(V + E)$.",

If $r$ has only one child $v$ in $G_\\pi$ then it must be the case that there is a path from $v$ to each of $r$'s other children. Since removing $r$ disconnects the graph, there must exist vertices $u$ and $w$ such that the only paths from $u$ to $w$ contain $r$. \n\n\nTo reach $r$ from $u$, the path must first reach one of $r$'s children. This child is connect to $v$ via a path which doesn't contain $r$. \n\n\nTo reach $w$, the path must also leave $r$ through one of its children, which is also reachable by $v$. This implies that there is a path from $u$ to $w$ which doesn't contain $r$, a contradiction.\n\n\nNow suppose $r$ has at least two children $u$ and $v$ in $G_\\pi$. Then there is no path from $u$ to $v$ in $G$ which doesn't go through $r$, since otherwise $u$ would be an ancestor of $v$. Thus, removing $r$ disconnects the component containing $u$ and the component containing $v$, so $r$ is an articulation point.\n\n\nb.\n Suppose that $v$ is a nonroot vertex of $G_\\pi$ and that $v$ has a child $s$ such that neither $s$ nor any of $s$'s descendants have back edges to a proper ancestor of $v$. Let $r$ be an ancestor of $v$, and remove $v$ from $G$. Since we are in the undirected case, the only edges in the graph are tree edges or back edges, which means that every edge incident with $s$ takes us to a descendant of $s$, and no descendants have back edges, so at no point can we move up the tree by taking edges. Therefore $r$ is unreachable from $s$, so the graph is disconnected and $v$ is an articulation point.\n\n\nNow suppose that for every child of $v$ there exists a descendant of that child which has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$. Remove $v$ from $G$. Every subtree of $v$ is a connected component. Within a given subtree, find the vertex which has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$. Since the set $T$ of vertices which aren't descendants of $v$ form a connected component, we have that every subtree of $v$ is connected to $T$. Thus, the graph remains connected after the deletion of $v$ so $v$ is not an articulation point.\n\n\nc.\n Since $v$ is discovered before all of its descendants, the only back edges which could affect $v.low$ are ones which go from a descendant of $v$ to a proper ancestor of $v$. If we know $u.low$ for every child $u$ of $v$, then we can compute $v.low$ easily since all the information is coded in its descendants. \n\n\nThus, we can write the algorithm recursively: If $v$ is a leaf in $G_\\pi$ then $v.low$ is the minimum of $v.d$ and $w.d$ where $(v, w)$ is a back edge. If $v$ is not a leaf, $v$ is the minimum of $v.d$, $w.d$ where $w$ is a back edge, and $u.low$, where $u$ is a child of $v$. Computing $v.low$ for a vertex is linear in its degree. The sum of the vertices' degrees gives twice the number of edges, so the total runtime is $O(E)$.\n\n\nd.\n First apply the algorithm of part (c) in $O(E)$ to compute $v.low$ for all $v \\in V$. If $v.low$ = $v.d$ if and only if no descendant of $v$ has a back edge to a proper ancestor of $v$, if and only if $v$ is not an articulation point. \n\n\nThus, we need only check $v.low$ versus $v.d$ to decide in constant time whether or not $v$ is an articulation point, so the runtime is $O(E)$.\n\n\ne.\n An edge $(u, v)$ lies on a simple cycle if and only if there exists at least one path from $u$ to $v$ which doesn't contain the edge $(u, v)$, if and only if removing $(u, v)$ doesn't disconnect the graph, if and only if $(u, v)$ is not a bridge.\n\n\nf.\n A edge $(u, v)$ lies on a simple cycle in an undirected graph if and only if either both of its endpoints are articulation points, or one of its endpoints is an articulation point and the other is a vertex of degree $1$. Since we can compute all articulation points in $O(E)$ and we can decide whether or not a vertex has degree $1$ in constant time, we can run the algorithm in part (d) and then decide whether each edge is a bridge in constant time, so we can find all bridges in $O(E)$ time.\n\n\ng.\n It is clear that every nonbridge edge is in some biconnected component, so we need to show that if $C_1$ and $C_2$ are distinct biconnected components, then they contain no common edges. Suppose to the contrary that $(u, v)$ is in both $C_1$ and $C_2$. \n\n\nLet $(a, b)$ be any edge in $C_1$ and $(c, d)$ be any edge in $C_2$.\n\n\nThen $(a, b)$ lies on a simple cycle with $(u, v)$, consisting of the path\n\n\n$$a, b, p_1, \\ldots, p_k, u, v, p_{k + 1}, \\ldots, p_n, a.$$\n\n\nSimilarly, $(c, d)$ lies on a simple cycle with $(u, v)$ consisting of the path\n\n\n$$c, d, q_1, \\ldots, q_m, u, v, q_{m + 1}, \\ldots, q_l, c.$$\n\n\nThis means\n\n\n$$a, b, p_1, \\ldots, p_k, u, q_m, \\ldots, q_1, d, c, q_l , \\ldots, q_{m + 1}, v, p_{k + 1}, \\ldots, p_n,$$\n\n\nis a simple cycle containing $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$, a contradiction. Thus, the biconnected components form a partition.\n\n\nh.\n Locate all bridge edges in $O(E)$ time using the algorithm described in part (f). Remove each bridge from $E$. The biconnected components are now simply the edges in the connected components. Assuming this has been done, run the following algorithm, which clearly runs in $O(|E|)$ where $|E|$ is the number of edges originally in $G$.",

            "text": "An \nEuler tour\n of a strongly connected, directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is a cycle that traverses each edge of $G$ exactly once, although it may visit a vertex more than once.\n\n\na.\n Show that $G$ has an Euler tour if and only if $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for each vertex $v \\in V$.\n\n\nb.\n Describe an $O(E)$-time algorithm to find an Euler tour of $G$ if one exists. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Merge edge-disjoint cycles.)\n\n\n\n\na.\n An Euler tour is a single cycle that traverses each edge of $G$ exactly once, but it might not be a simple cycle. An Euler tour can be decomposed into a set of edge-disjoint simple cycles, however.\n\n\nIf $G$ has an Euler tour, therefore, we can look at the simple cycles that, together, form the tour. In each simple cycle, each vertex in the cycle has one entering edge and one leaving edge. In each simple cycle, therefore, each vertex $v$ has $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$, where the degrees are either $1$ (if $v$ is on the simple cycle) or $0$ (if $v$ is not on the simple cycle). Adding the in- and out- degrees over all edges proves that if $G$ has an Euler tour, then $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n\nWe prove the converse\u2014that if $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$, then $G$ has an Euler tour\u2014in two different ways. One proof is nonconstructive, and the other proof will help us design the algorithm for part (b).\n\n\nFirst, we claim that if $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$, then we can pick any vertex $u$ for which $\\text{in-degree}(u) = \\text{out-degree}(u) \\ge 1$ and create a cycle (not necessarily simple) that contains $u$. To prove this claim, let us start by placing vertex $u$ on the cycle, and choose any leaving edge of $u$, say ($u, v$). Now we put $v$ on the cycle. Since $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v) \\ge 1$, we can pick some leaving edge of $v$ and continue visiting edges and vertices. Each time we pick an edge, we can remove it from further consideration. At each vertex other than $u$, at the time we visit an entering edge, there must be an unvisited leaving edge, since $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$. The only vertex for which there might not be an unvisited leaving edge is $u$, since we started the cycle by visiting one of $u$'s leaving edges. Since there's always a leaving edge we can visit from all vertices other than $u$, eventually the cycle must return to $u$, thus proving the claim.\n\n\nThe nonconstructive proof proves the contrapositive\u2014that if $G$ does not have an Euler tour, then $\\text{in-degree}(v) \\ne \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for some vertex $v$\u2014by contradiction. Choose a graph $G = (V, E)$ that does not have an Euler tour but has at least one edge and for which $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$, and let $G$ have the fewest edges of any such graph. By the above claim, $G$ contains a cycle. Let $C$ be a cycle of $G$ with the greatest number of edges, and let $V_C$ be the set of vertices visited by cycle $C$. By our assumption, $C$ is not an Euler tour, and so the set of edges $E' = E - C$ is nonempty. If we use the set $V$ of vertices and the set $E'$ of edges, we get the graph $G' = (V, E')$; this graph has $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$, since we have removed one entering edge and one leaving edge for each vertex on cycle $C$. Consider any component $G'' = (V'' , E'')$ of $G'$, and observe that $G''$ also has $\\text{in-degree}(v) = \\text{out-degree}(v)$ for all vertices $v$. Since $E'' \\subseteq E' \\subsetneq E$, it follows from how we chose $G$ that $G''$  must have an Euler tour, say $C'$. Because the original graph G is connected, there must be some vertex $x \\in V'' \\cup V_C$ and, without loss of generality, consider $x$ to be the first and last vertex on both $C$ and $C'$. But then the cycle $C''$ formed by first traversing $C$ and then traversing $C'$ is a cycle of $G$ with more edges than $C$, contradicting our choice of $C$. We conclude that $C$ must have been an Euler tour.\n\n\nThe constructive proof uses the same ideas. Let us start at a vertex $u$ and, via random traversal of edges, create a cycle. We know that once we take any edge entering a vertex $v \\ne u$, we can find an edge leaving $v$ that we have not yet taken. Eventually, we get back to vertex $u$, and if there are still edges leaving $u$ that we have not taken, we can continue the cycle. Eventually, we get back to vertex $u$ and there are no untaken edges leaving $u$. If we have visited every edge in the graph $G$, we are done. Otherwise, since $G$ is connected, there must be some unvisited edge leaving a vertex, say $v$, on the cycle. We can traverse a new cycle starting at $v$, visiting only previously unvisited edges, and we can splice this cycle into the cycle we already know. That is, if the original cycle is $\\langle u, \\ldots, v, w, \\ldots, u \\rangle$, and the new cycle is $\\langle v, x, \\ldots, v\\rangle$, then we can create the cycle $\\langle u, \\ldots, v, x, \\ldots, v, w, \\ldots, u \\rangle$. We continue this process of finding a vertex with an unvisited leaving edge on a visited cycle, visiting a cycle starting and ending at this vertex, and splicing in the newly visited cycle, until we have visited every edge.\n\n\nb.\n The algorithm is based on the idea in the constructive proof above.\n\n\nWe assume that $G$ is represented by adjacency lists, and we work with a copy of the adjacency lists, so that as we visit each edge, we can remove it from its adjacency list. The singly linked form of adjacency list will suffice. The output of this algorithm is a doubly linked list $T$ of vertices which, read in list order, will give an Euler tour. The algorithm constructs $T$ by finding cycles (also represented by doubly linked lists) and splicing them into $T$. By using doubly linked lists for cycles and the Euler tour, splicing a cycle into the Euler tour takes constant time.\n\n\nWe also maintain a singly linked list $L$, in which each list element consists of two parts:\n\n\n\n\na vertex $v$, and\n\n\na pointer to some appearance of $v$ in $T$.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, $L$ contains one vertex, which may be any vertex of $G$.\n\n\nHere is the algorithm.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nEULER\n-\nTOUR\n(\nG\n)\n\n    \nT\n \n=\n \nempty\n \nlist\n\n    \nL\n \n=\n \n(\nany\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n,\n \nNIL\n)\n\n    \nwhile\n \nL\n \nis\n \nnot\n \nempty\n\n        \nremore\n \n(\nv\n,\n \nlocation\n \n-\n \nin\n-\nT\n)\n \nfrom\n \nL\n\n        \nC\n \n=\n \nVISIT\n(\nG\n,\n \nL\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n        \nif\n \nlocation\n \n-\n \nin\n-\nT\n \n==\n \nNIL\n\n            \nT\n \n=\n \nC\n\n        \nelse\n \nsplice\n \nC\n \ninto\n \nT\n \njust\n \nbefore\n \nlocation\n \n-\n \nin\n-\nT\n\n    \nreturn\n \nT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nVISIT\n(\nG\n,\n \nL\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n    \nC\n \n=\n \nempty\n \nsequence\n \nof\n \nvertices\n\n    \nu\n \n=\n \nv\n\n    \nwhile\n \nout\n-\ndegree\n(\nu\n)\n \n>\n \n0\n\n        \nlet\n \nw\n \nbe\n \nthe\n \nfirst\n \nvertex\n \nin\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nu\n]\n\n        \nremove\n \nw\n \nfrom\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nu\n],\n \ndecrementing\n \nout\n-\ndegree\n(\nu\n)\n\n        \nadd\n \nu\n \nonto\n \nthe\n \nend\n \nof\n \nC\n\n        \nif\n \nout\n-\ndegree\n(\nu\n)\n \n>\n \n0\n\n            \nadd\n \n(\nu\n,\n \nu\n'\ns\n \nlocation\n \nin\n \nC\n)\n \nto\n \nL\n\n        \nu\n \n=\n \nw\n\n    \nreturn\n \nC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of $\\text{NIL}$ in the initial assignment to $L$ ensures that the first cycle $C$ returned by $\\text{VISIT}$ becomes the current version of the Euler tour $T$. All cycles returned by $\\text{VISIT}$ thereafter are spliced into $T$. We assume that whenever an empty cycle is returned by $\\text{VISIT}$, splicing it into $T$ leaves $T$ unchanged.\n\n\nEach time that $\\text{EULER-TOUR}$ removes a vertex $v$ from the list $L$, it calls $\\text{VISIT}(G, L, v)$ to find a cycle $C$, possibly empty and possibly not simple, that starts and ends at $v$; the cycle $C$ is represented by a list that starts with $v$ and ends with the last vertex on the cycle before the cycle ends at $v$. $\\text{EULER-TOUR}$ then splices this cycle $C$ into the Euler tour $T$ just before some appearance of $v$ in $T$.\n\n\nWhen $\\text{VISIT}$ is at a vertex $u$, it looks for some vertex $w$ such that the edge $(u, w)$ has not yet been visited. Removing $w$ from $Adj[u]$ ensures that we will never visit $(u, w)$ again. $\\text{VISIT}$ adds $u$ onto the cycle $C$ that it constructs. If, after removing edge $(u, w)$, vertex $u$ still has any leaving edges, then $u$, along with its location in $C$, is added to $L$. The cycle construction continues from $w$, and it ceases once a vertex with no unvisited leaving edges is found. Using the argument from part (a), at that point, this vertex must close up a cycle. At that point, therefore, the cycle $C$ is returned.\n\n\nIt is possible that a vertex $u$ has unvisited leaving edges at the time it is added to list $L$ in $\\text{VISIT}$, but that by the time that $u$ is removed from $L$ in $\\text{EULER-TOUR}$, all of its leaving edges have been visited. In this case, the \nwhile\n loop of $\\text{VISIT}$ executes $0$ iterations, and $\\text{VISIT}$ returns an empty cycle.\n\n\nOnce the list $L$ is empty, every edge has been visited. The resulting cycle $T$ is then an Euler tour.\n\n\nTo see that $\\text{EULER-TOUR}$ takes $O(E)$ time, observe that because we remove each edge from its adjacency list as it is visited, no edge is visited more than once. Since each edge is visited at some time, the number of times that a vertex is added to $L$, and thus removed from $L$, is at most $|E|$. Thus, the \nwhile\n loop in $\\text{EULER-TOUR}$ executes at most $E$ iterations. The \nwhile\n loop in $\\text{VISIT}$ executes one iteration per edge in the graph, and so it executes at most $E$ iterations as well. Since adding vertex $u$ to the doubly linked list $C$ takes constant time and splicing $C$ into $T$ takes constant time, the entire algorithm takes $O(E)$ time.",

Since $G$ is a tree, its minimum spanning tree is itself, so $A$ is trivially a subset of a minimum spanning tree.\n\n\nMoreover, every edge is safe.

For any of these cuts, we know that the edge $e$ is not a light edge for this cut. Since all the other cuts won't have the edge $e$ crossing it, we won't have that the edge is light for any of those cuts either. This means that we have that e is not safe.\n\n\n23.1-6\n\n\n\n\nShow that a graph has a unique minimum spanning tree if, for every cut of the graph, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Show that the converse is not true by giving a counterexample.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that for every cut of $G$, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Let us consider two distinct minimum spanning trees, $T$ and $T'$, of $G$. Because $T$ and $T'$are distinct, $T$ contains some edge $(u, v)$ that is not in $T'$. If we remove $(u, v)$ from $T$, then $T$ becomes disconnected, resulting in a cut $(S, V - S)$. The edge $(u, v)$ is a light edge crossing the cut $(S, V - S)$ (by Exercise 23.1-3) and, by our assumption, it's the only light edge crossing this cut. Because $(u, v)$ is the only light edge crossing $(S, V - S)$ and $(u, v)$ is not in $T'$, each edge in $T'$ that crosses $(S, V - S)$ must have weight strictly greater than w$(u, v)$. As in the proof of Theorem 23.1, we can identify the unique edge $(x, y)$ in $T'$ that crosses $(S, V - S)$ and lies on the cycle that results if we add $(u, v)$ to $T'$. By our assumption, we know that $w(u, v) < w(x, y)$. Then, we can then remove $(x, y)$ from $T'$ and replace it by $(u, v)$, giving a spanning tree with weight strictly less than $w(T')$. Thus, $T'$ was not a minimum spanning tree, contradicting the assumption that the graph had two unique minimum spanning trees.\n\n\nHere's a counterexample for the converse:\n\n\n\n\nHere, the graph is its own minimum spanning tree, and so the minimum spanning tree is unique. Consider the cut $(\\{x\\}, \\{y, z\\})$. Both of the edges $(x, y)$ and $(x, z)$ are light edges crossing the cut, and they are both light edges.\n\n\n23.1-7\n\n\n\n\nArgue that if all edge weights of a graph are positive, then any subset of edges that connects all vertices and has minimum total weight must be a tree. Give an example to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be nonpositive.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we show that the subset of edges of minimum total weight that connects all the vertices is a tree. To see this, suppose not, that it had a cycle. This would mean that removing any of the edges in this cycle would mean that the remaining edges would still connect all the vertices, but would have a total weight that's less by the weight of the edge that was removed. This would contradict the minimality of the total weight of the subset of vertices. Since the subset of edges forms a tree, and has minimal total weight, it must also be a minimum spanning tree.\n\n\nTo see that this conclusion is not true if we allow negative edge weights, we provide a construction. Consider the graph $K_3$ with all edge weights equal to $-1$. The only minimum weight set of edges that connects the graph has total weight $-3$, and consists of all the edges. This is clearly not a $\\text{MST}$ because it is not a tree, which can be easily seen because it has one more edge than a tree on three vertices should have. Any $\\text{MST}$ of this weighted graph must have weight that is at least $-2$.\n\n\n23.1-8\n\n\n\n\nLet $T$ be a minimum spanning tree of a graph $G$, and let $L$ be the sorted list of the edge weights of $T$. Show that for any other minimum spanning tree $T'$ of $G$, the list $L$ is also the sorted list of edge weights of $T'$.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that $L'$ is another sorted list of edge weights of a minimum spanning tree. If $L' \\ne L$, there must be a first edge $(u, v)$ in $T$ or $T'$ which is of smaller weight than the corresponding edge $(x, y)$ in the other set. Without loss of generality, assume $(u, v)$ is in $T$. \n\n\nLet $C$ be the graph obtained by adding $(u, v)$ to $L'$. Then we must have introduced a cycle. If there exists an edge on that cycle which is of larger weight than $(u, v)$, we can remove it to obtain a tree $C'$ of weight strictly smaller than the weight of $T'$, contradicting the fact that $T'$ is a minimum spanning tree. \n\n\nThus, every edge on the cycle must be of lesser or equal weight than $(u, v)$. Suppose that every edge is of strictly smaller weight. Remove $(u, v)$ from $T$ to disconnect it into two components. There must exist some edge besides $(u, v)$ on the cycle which would connect these, and since it has smaller weight we can use that edge instead to create a spanning tree with less weight than $T$, a contradiction. Thus, some edge on the cycle has the same weight as $(u, v)$. Replace that edge by $(u, v)$. The corresponding lists $L$ and $L'$ remain unchanged since we have swapped out an edge of equal weight, but the number of edges which $T$ and $T'$ have in common has increased by $1$.\n\n\nIf we continue in this way, eventually they must have every edge in common, contradicting the fact that their edge weights differ somewhere.

Show that the converse is not true by giving a counterexample.   Suppose that for every cut of $G$, there is a unique light edge crossing the cut. Let us consider two distinct minimum spanning trees, $T$ and $T'$, of $G$. Because $T$ and $T'$are distinct, $T$ contains some edge $(u, v)$ that is not in $T'$. If we remove $(u, v)$ from $T$, then $T$ becomes disconnected, resulting in a cut $(S, V - S)$. The edge $(u, v)$ is a light edge crossing the cut $(S, V - S)$ (by Exercise 23.1-3) and, by our assumption, it's the only light edge crossing this cut. Because $(u, v)$ is the only light edge crossing $(S, V - S)$ and $(u, v)$ is not in $T'$, each edge in $T'$ that crosses $(S, V - S)$ must have weight strictly greater than w$(u, v)$.

Give an example to show that the same conclusion does not follow if we allow some weights to be nonpositive.   First, we show that the subset of edges of minimum total weight that connects all the vertices is a tree. To see this, suppose not, that it had a cycle. This would mean that removing any of the edges in this cycle would mean that the remaining edges would still connect all the vertices, but would have a total weight that's less by the weight of the edge that was removed. This would contradict the minimality of the total weight of the subset of vertices. Since the subset of edges forms a tree, and has minimal total weight, it must also be a minimum spanning tree.  To see that this conclusion is not true if we allow negative edge weights, we provide a construction. Consider the graph $K_3$ with all edge weights equal to $-1$. The only minimum weight set of edges that connects the graph has total weight $-3$, and consists of all the edges.

Thus, every edge on the cycle must be of lesser or equal weight than $(u, v)$. Suppose that every edge is of strictly smaller weight. Remove $(u, v)$ from $T$ to disconnect it into two components.

How fast can you make Kruskal's algorithm run? What if the edge weights are integers in the range from $1$ to $W$ for some constant $W$?\n\n\n\n\nWe know that Kruskal's algorithm takes $O(V)$ time for initialization, $O(E\\lg E)$ time to sort the edges, and $O(E\\alpha(V))$ time for the disjoint-set operations, for a total running time of $O(V + E\\lg E + E\\alpha(V)) = O(E\\lg E)$.\n\n\nIf we knew that all of the edge weights in the graph were integers in the range from $1$ to $|V|$, then we could sort the edges in $O(V + E)$ time using counting sort. Since the graph is connected, $V = O(E)$, and so the sorting time is reduced to $O(E)$. This would yield a total running time of $O(V + E + E\\alpha(V)) = O(E\\alpha(V))$, again since $V = O(E)$, and since $E = O(E\\alpha(V))$. The time to process the edges, not the time to sort them, is now the dominant term. Knowledge about the weights won't help speed up any other part of the algorithm, since nothing besides the sort uses the weight values.\n\n\nIf the edge weights were integers in the range from $1$ to $W$ for some constant $W$, then we could again use counting sort to sort the edges more quickly. This time, sorting would take $O(E + W) = O(E)$ time, since $W$ is a constant. As in the first part, we get a total running time of $O(E\\alpha(V))$.\n\n\n23.2-5\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that all edge weights in a graph are integers in the range from $1$ to $|V|$. How fast can you make Prim's algorithm run? What if the edge weights are integers in the range from $1$ to $W$ for some constant $W$?\n\n\n\n\nThe time taken by Prim's algorithm is determined by the speed of the queue operations. With the queue implemented as a Fibonacci heap, it takes $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time.\n\n\nSince the keys in the priority queue are edge weights, it might be possible to implement the queue even more efficiently when there are restrictions on the possible edge weights.\n\n\nWe can improve the running time of Prim's algorithm if $W$ is a constant by implementing the queue as an array $Q[0..W + 1]$ (using the $W + 1$ slot for $\\text{key} = \\infty$), where each slot holds a doubly linked list of vertices with that weight as their key. Then $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ takes only $O(W) = O(1)$ time (just scan for the first nonempty slot), and $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ takes only $O(1)$ time (just remove the vertex from the list it's in and insert it at the front of the list indexed by the new key). This gives a total running time of $O(E)$, which is the best possible asymptotic time (since $\\Omega(E)$ edges must be processed).\n\n\nHowever, if the range of edge weights is $1$ to $|V|$, then $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ takes $\\Theta(V)$ time with this data structure. So the total time spent doing $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ is $\\Theta(V^2)$, slowing the algorithm to $\\Theta(E + V^2) = \\Theta(V^2)$. In this case, it is better to keep the Fibonacci-heap priority queue, which gave the $\\Theta(E + V\\lg V)$ time.\n\n\nOther data structures yield better running times:\n\n\n\n\nvan Emde Boas trees (see Chapter 20) give an upper bound of $O(E + V\\lg\\lg V)$ time for Prim's algorithm.\n\n\nA redistributive heap (used in the single-source shortest-paths algorithm of Ahuja, Mehlhorn, Orlin, and Tarjan, and mentioned in the chapter notes for Chapter 24) gives an upper bound of $O(E + V \\sqrt{\\lg V})$ for Prim's algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n23.2-6 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that the edge weights in a graph are uniformly distributed over the halfopen interval $[0, 1)$.

How quickly can we update the minimum spanning tree if we add a new vertex and incident edges to $G$?\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the following lemma.\n\n\nLemma\n\n\nLet $T$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G = (V, E)$, and consider a graph $G' = (V', E')$ for which $G$ is a subgraph, i.e., $V \\subseteq V'$ and $E \\subseteq E'$. Let $\\overline T = E - T$ be the edges of $G$ that are not in $T$. Then there is a minimum spanning tree of $G'$ that includes no edges in $\\overline T$.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nBy Exercise 23.2-1, there is a way to order the edges of $E$ so that Kruskal's algorithm, when run on $G$, produces the minimum spanning tree $T$. We will show that Kruskal's algorithm, run on $G'$, produces a minimum spanning tree $T'$ that includes no edges in $\\overline T$. We assume that the edges in $E$ are considered in the same relative order when Kruskal's algorithm is run on $G$ and on $G'$. We first state and prove the following claim.\n\n\nClaim\n \n\n\nFor any pair of vertices $u, v \\in V$, if these vertices are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ considers any edge $(x, y) \\in E$, then they are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ considers $(x, y)$.\n\n\nProof of claim\n \n\n\nLet us order the edges of $E$ by nondecreasing weight as $\\langle (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_k, y_k) \\rangle$, where $k = |E|$. This sequence gives the order in which the edges of $E$ are considered by Kruskal's algorithm, whether it is run on $G$ or on $G'$. We will use induction, with the inductive hypothesis that if $u$ and $v$ are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ considers an edge $(x_i, y_i)$, then they are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ considers the same edge. We use induction on $i$.\n\n\nBasis:\n For the basis, $i = 0$. Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ has not considered any edges, and so all vertices are in different sets. The inductive hypothesis holds trivially.\n\n\nInductive step:\n We assume that any vertices that are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ has considered edges $\\langle (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_{i - 1}, y_{i - 1}) \\rangle$ are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ has considered the same edges. When Kruskal's algorithm runs on $G'$, after it considers $(x_{i - 1}, y_{i - 1})$, it may consider some edges in $E' - E$ before considering $(x_i, y_i)$. The edges in $E' - E$ may cause $\\text{UNION}$ operations to occur, but sets are never divided. Hence, any vertices that are in the same set after Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ considers $(x_{i - 1}, y_{i - 1})$ are still in the same set when $(x_i, y_i)$ is considered.\n\n\nWhen Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ considers $(x_i, y_i)$, either $x_i$ and $y_i$ are found to be in the same set or they are not.\n\n\n\n\nIf Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ finds $x_i$ and $y_i$ to be in the same set, then no $\\text{UNION}$ operation occurs. The sets of vertices remain the same, and so the inductive hypothesis continues to hold after considering $(x_i, y_i)$.\n\n\nIf Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ finds $x_i$ and $y_i$ to be in different sets, then the operation $\\text{UNION}(x_i, y_i)$ will occur. Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ will find that either $x_i$ and $y_i$ are in the same set or they are not. By the inductive hypothesis, when edge $(x_i, y_i)$ is considered, all vertices in $x_i$'s set when Kruskal's algorithm runs on $G$ are in $x_i$'s set when Kruskal's algorithm runs on $G'$, and the same holds for $y_i$. Regardless of whether Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ finds $x_i$ and $y_i$ to already be in the same set, their sets are united after considering $(x_i, y_i)$, and so the inductive hypothesis continues to hold after considering $(x_i, y_i)$. (#claim)\n\n\n\n\nWith the claim in hand, we suppose that some edge $(u, v) \\in \\overline T$ is placed into $T'$. That means that Kruskal's algorithm run on $G$ found $u$ and $v$ to be in the same set (since $(u, v) \\in \\overline T$ ) but Kruskal's algorithm run on $G'$ found $u$ and $v$ to be in different sets (since $(u, v)$ is placed into $T'$). This fact contradicts the claim, and we conclude that no edge in $\\overline T$ is placed into $T'$. Thus, by running Kruskal's algorithm on $G$ and $G'$, we demonstrate that there exists a minimum spanning tree of $G'$ that includes no edges in $\\overline T$. (#lemma)\n\n\nWe use this lemma as follows. Let $G' = (V', E')$ be the graph $G = (V, E)$ with the one new vertex and its incident edges added. Suppose that we have a minimum spanning tree $T$ for $G$. We compute a minimum spanning tree for $G'$ by creating the graph $G'' = (V', E'')$, where $E''$ consists of the edges of $T$ and the edges in $E' - E$ (i.e., the edges added to $G$ that made $G'$), and then finding a minimum spanning tree $T'$ for $G''$. By the lemma, there is a minimum spanning tree for $G'$ that includes no edges of $E - T$. In other words, $G'$ has a minimum spanning tree that includes only edges in $T$ and $E' - E$ ; these edges comprise exactly the set $E''$. Thus, the the minimum spanning tree $T'$ of $G''$ is also a minimum spanning tree of $G'$.\n\n\nEven though the proof of the lemma uses Kruskal's algorithm, we are not required to use this algorithm to find $T'$. We can find a minimum spanning tree by any means we choose. Let us use Prim's algorithm with a Fibonacci-heap priority queue. Since $|V'| = |V| + 1$ and $|E''| \\le 2|V| - 1$ ($E''$ contains the $|V| - 1$ edges of $T$ and at most $|V|$ edges in $E' - E$ ), it takes $O(V)$ time to construct $G''$, and the run of Prim's algorithm with a Fibonacci-heap priority queue takes time $O(E'' + V'\\lg V) = O(V\\lg V)$. Thus, if we are given a minimum spanning tree of $G$, we can compute a minimum spanning tree of $G'$ in $O(V\\lg V)$ time.\n\n\n23.2-8\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Borden proposes a new divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing minimum spanning trees, which goes as follows. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, partition the set $V$ of vertices into two sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that $|V_1|$ and $|V_2|$ differ by at most $1$. Let $E_1$ be the set of edges that are incident only on vertices in $V_1$, and let $E_2$ be the set of edges that are incident only on vertices in $V_2$. Recursively solve a minimum-spanning-tree problem on each of the two subgraphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$. Finally, select the minimum-weight edge in $E$ that crosses the cut $(V_1, V_2)$, and use this edge to unite the resulting two minimum spanning trees into a single spanning tree.\n\n\nEither argue that the algorithm correctly computes a minimum spanning tree of $G$, or provide an example for which the algorithm fails.\n\n\n\n\nThe algorithm fails. Suppose $E = \\{(u, v), (u, w), (v, w)\\}$, the weight of $(u, v)$ and $(u, w)$ is $1$, and the weight of $(v, w)$ is $1000$, partition the set into two sets $V_1 = \\{u\\}$ and $V_2 = \\{v, w\\}$.",

How must the sizes $|E|$ and $|V|$ be related for the Fibonacci-heap implementation to be asymptotically faster than the binary-heap implementation?   Prim's algorithm implemented with a Binary heap has runtime $O((V + E)\\lg V)$, which in the sparse case, is just $O(V\\lg V)$. The implementation with Fibonacci heaps is  $$O(E + V\\lg V) = O(V + V\\lg V) = O(V \\lg V).$$   In the sparse case, the two algorithms have the same asymptotic runtimes.   In the dense case.

What if the edge weights are integers in the range from $1$ to $W$ for some constant $W$?   The time taken by Prim's algorithm is determined by the speed of the queue operations. With the queue implemented as a Fibonacci heap, it takes $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time.  Since the keys in the priority queue are edge weights, it might be possible to implement the queue even more efficiently when there are restrictions on the possible edge weights.  We can improve the running time of Prim's algorithm if $W$ is a constant by implementing the queue as an array $Q[0..W + 1]$ (using the $W + 1$ slot for $\\text{key} = \\infty$), where each slot holds a doubly linked list of vertices with that weight as their key. Then $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ takes only $O(W) = O(1)$ time (just scan for the first nonempty slot), and $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ takes only $O(1)$ time (just remove the vertex from the list it's in and insert it at the front of the list indexed by the new key). This gives a total running time of $O(E)$, which is the best possible asymptotic time (since $\\Omega(E)$ edges must be processed).  However, if the range of edge weights is $1$ to $|V|$, then $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ takes $\\Theta(V)$ time with this data structure. So the total time spent doing $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ is $\\Theta(V^2)$, slowing the algorithm to $\\Theta(E + V^2) = \\Theta(V^2)$. In this case, it is better to keep the Fibonacci-heap priority queue, which gave the $\\Theta(E + V\\lg V)$ time.  Other data structures yield better running times:   van Emde Boas trees (see Chapter 20) give an upper bound of $O(E + V\\lg\\lg V)$ time for Prim's algorithm.

Prove that $G$ contains edges $(u, v) \\in T$ and $(x, y) \\notin T$ such that $T - \\{(u, v)\\} \\cup \\{(x, y)\\}$ is a second-best minimum spanning tree of $G$.\n\n\nc.\n Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G$ and, for any two vertices $u, v \\in V$, let $max[u, v]$ denote an edge of maximum weight on the unique simple path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$. Describe an $O(V^2)$-time algorithm that, given $T$, computes $max[u, v]$ for all $u, v \\in V$.\n\n\nd.\n Give an efficient algorithm to compute the second-best minimum spanning tree of $G$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n To see that the minimum spanning tree is unique, observe that since the graph is connected and all edge weights are distinct, then there is a unique light edge crossing every cut. By Exercise 23.1-6, the minimum spanning tree is unique.\n\n\nTo see that the second-best minimum spanning tree need not be unique, here is a weighted, undirected graph with a unique minimum spanning tree of weight $7$ and two second-best minimum spanning trees of weight $8$:\n\n\n\n\nb.\n Since any spanning tree has exactly $|V| - 1$ edges, any second-best minimum spanning tree must have at least one edge that is not in the (best) minimum spanning tree. If a second-best minimum spanning tree has exactly one edge, say $(x, y)$, that is not in the minimum spanning tree, then it has the same set of edges as the minimum spanning tree, except that $(x, y)$ replaces some edge, say $(u, v)$, of the minimum spanning tree. In this case, $T' = T - \\{(u, v)\\} \\cup \\{(x, y)\\}$, as we wished to show.\n\n\nThus, all we need to show is that by replacing two or more edges of the minimum spanning tree, we cannot obtain a second-best minimum spanning tree. Let $T$ be the minimum spanning tree of $G$, and suppose that there exists a second-best minimum spanning tree $T'$ that differs from $T$ by two or more edges. There are at least two edges in $T - T'$, and let $(u, v)$ be the edge in $T - T'$ with minimum weight. If we were to add $(u, v)$ to $T'$, we would get a cycle $c$. This cycle contains some edge $(x, y)$ in $T' - T$ (since otherwise, $T$ would contain a cycle).\n\n\nWe claim that $w(x, y) > w(u, v)$. We prove this claim by contradiction, so let us assume that $w(x, y) < w(u, v)$. (Recall the assumption that edge weights are distinct, so that we do not have to concern ourselves with $w(x, y) = w(u, v)$.) If we add $(x, y)$ to $T$, we get a cycle $c'$, which contains some edge$(u', v')$ in $T - T'$ (since otherwise, $T'$ would contain a cycle). Therefore, the set of edges $T'' = T - \\{(u', v')\\} \\cup \\{(x, y)\\}$ forms a spanning tree, and we must also have $w(u', v') < w(x, y)$, since otherwise $T''$ would be a spanning tree with weight less than $w(T)$. Thus, $w(u', v') < w(x, y) < w(u, v)$, which contradicts our choice of $(u, v)$ as the edge in $T - T'$ of minimum weight.\n\n\nSince the edges $(u, v)$ and $(x, y)$ would be on a common cycle $c$ if we were to add $(u, v)$ to $T'$, the set of edges $T' - \\{(x, y)\\} \\cup \\{(u, v)\\}$ is a spanning tree, and its weight is less than $w(T')$. Moreover, it differs from $T$ (because it differs from $T'$ by only one edge). Thus, we have formed a spanning tree whose weight is less than $w(T')$ but is not $T$. Hence, $T'$ was not a second-best minimum spanning tree.\n\n\nc.\n We can fill in $max[u, v]$ for all $u, v \\in V$ in $O(V^2)$ time by simply doing a search from each vertex $u$, having restricted the edges visited to those of the spanning tree $T$. It doesn't matter what kind of search we do: breadth-first, depth-first, or any other kind.\n\n\nWe'll give pseudocode for both breadth-first and depth-first approaches. Each approach differs from the pseudocode given in Chapter 22 in that we don't need to compute $d$ or $f$ values, and we'll use the $max$ table itself to record whether a vertex has been visited in a given search. In particular, $max[u, v] = \\text{NIL}$ if and only if $u = v$ or we have not yet visited vertex $v$ in a search from vertex $u$. Note also that since we're visiting via edges in a spanning tree of an undirected graph, we are guaranteed that the search from each vertex $u$\u2014whether breadth-first or depth-first\u2014will visit all vertices. There will be no need to ''restart'' the search as is done in the $\\text{DFS}$ procedure of Section 22.3. Our pseudocode assumes that the adjacency list of each vertex consists only of edges in the spanning tree $T$.\n\n\nHere's the breadth-first search approach:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\nBFS\n-\nFILL\n-\nMAX\n(\nG\n,\n \nT\n,\n \nw\n)\n\n    \nlet\n \nmax\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \ntable\n \nwith\n \nan\n \nentry\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \nfor\n \neach\n \nu\n,\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n\n    \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nu\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n\n        \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n\n            \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n        \nQ\n \n=\n \n\u2205\n\n        \nENQUEUE\n(\nQ\n,\n \nu\n)\n\n        \nwhile\n \nQ\n \n!=\n \n\u2205\n\n            \nx\n \n=\n \nDEQUEUE\n(\nQ\n)\n\n            \nfor\n \neach\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nx\n]\n\n                \nif\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n==\n \nNIL\n \nand\n \nv\n \n!=\n \nu\n\n                    \nif\n \nx\n \n==\n \nu\n \nor\n \nw\n(\nx\n,\n \nv\n)\n \n>\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nx\n]\n\n                        \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \n(\nx\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n                    \nelse\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nx\n]\n\n                    \nENQUEUE\n(\nQ\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the depth-first search approach:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nDFS\n-\nFILL\n-\nMAX\n(\nG\n,\n \nT\n,\n \nw\n)\n\n    \nlet\n \nmax\n \nbe\n \na\n \nnew\n \ntable\n \nwith\n \nan\n \nentry\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \nfor\n \neach\n \nu\n,\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n \n    \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nu\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n\n        \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nV\n\n            \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \nNIL\n\n        \nDFS\n-\nFILL\n-\nMAX\n-\nVISIT\n(\nG\n,\n \nu\n,\n \nu\n,\n \nmax\n)\n\n    \nreturn\n \nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nDFS\n-\nFILL\n-\nMAX\n-\nVISIT\n(\nG\n,\n \nu\n,\n \nx\n,\n \nmax\n)\n\n    \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nx\n]\n\n        \nif\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n==\n \nNIL\n \nand\n \nv\n \n!=\n \nu\n\n            \nif\n \nx\n \n==\n \nu\n \nor\n \nw\n(\nx\n,\n \nv\n)\n \n>\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nx\n]\n\n                \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \n(\nx\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n            \nelse\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nv\n]\n \n=\n \nmax\n[\nu\n,\n \nx\n]\n\n            \nDFS\n-\nFILL\n-\nMAX\n-\nVISIT\n(\nG\n,\n \nu\n,\n \nv\n,\n \nmax\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor either approach, we are filling in $|V|$ rows of the $max$ table. Since the number of edges in the spanning tree is $|V| - 1$, each row takes $O(V)$ time to fill in. Thus, the total time to fill in the $max$ table is $O(V^2)$.\n\n\nd.\n In part (b), we established that we can find a second-best minimum spanning tree by replacing just one edge of the minimum spanning tree $T$ by some edge $(u, v)$ not in $T$. As we know, if we create spanning tree $T'$ by replacing edge $(x, y) \\in T$ by edge $(u, v) \\ne T$, then $w(T') = w(T) - w(x, y) + w(u, v)$. For a given edge $(u, v)$, the edge $(x, y) \\in T$ that minimizes $w(T')$ is the edge of maximum weight on the unique path between $u$ and $v$ in $T$. If we have already computed the $max$ table from part (c) based on $T$, then the identity of this edge is precisely what is stored in $max[u, v]$. All we have to do is determine an edge $(u, v) \\ne T$ for which $w(max[u, v]) - w(u, v)$ is minimum.\n\n\nThus, our algorithm to find a second-best minimum spanning tree goes as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCompute the minimum spanning tree $T$. Time: $O(E + V\\lg V)$, using Prim's algorithm with a Fibonacci-heap implementation of the priority queue. Since $|E| < |V|^2$, this running time is $O(V^2)$.\n\n\nGiven the minimum spanning tree $T$, compute the $max$ table, as in part (c). Time: $O(V^2)$.\n\n\nFind an edge $(u, v) \\ne T$ that minimizes $w(max[u, v]) - w(u, v)$. Time: $O(E)$, which is $O(V^2)$.\n\n\nHaving found an edge $(u, v)$ in step 3, return $T' = T - \\{max[u, v]\\} \\cup \\{(u, v)\\}$ as a second-best minimum spanning tree.\n\n\n\n\nThe total time is $O(V^2)$.",

In particular, we choose, for each vertex $u$, the minimum-weight edge $(u, v)$ incident on $u$, and we put $(u, v)$ into the minimum spanning tree under construction. We then contract all chosen edges (see Section B.4). Rather than contracting these edges one at a time, we first identify sets of vertices that are united into the same new vertex. Then we create the graph that would have resulted from contracting these edges one at a time, but we do so by ''renaming'' edges according to the sets into which their endpoints were placed. Several edges from the original graph may be renamed the same as each other. In such a case, only one edge results, and its weight is the minimum of the weights of the corresponding original edges.\n\n\nInitially, we set the minimum spanning tree $T$ being constructed to be empty, and for each edge $(u, v) \\in E$, we initialize the attributes $(u, v).orig = (u, v)$ and $(u, v).c = w(u, v)$. We use the $orig$ attribute to reference the edge from the initial graph that is associated with an edge in the contracted graph. The $c$ attribute holds the weight of an edge, and as edges are contracted, we update it according to the above scheme for choosing edge weights. The procedure $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$ takes inputs $G$ and $T$, and it returns a contracted graph $G'$ with updated attributes $orig'$ and $c'$.

Consider an unmarked vertex $u$. Set $S = {u}$ and let $A$ be the set of edges in the tree so far. Then the cut respects $A$, and the next edge we add is a light edge, so it is safe for $A$. Thus, every edge in $T$ before we run Prim's algorithm is safe for $T$. Any edge that Prim's would normally add at this point would have to connect two of the trees already created, and it would be chosen as minimal. Moreover, we choose exactly one between any two trees. Thus, the fact that we only have the smallest edges available to us is not a problem. The resulting tree must be minimal.\n\n\nb.\n We argue by induction on the number of vertices in $G$. We'll assume that $|V| > 1$, since otherwise $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$ will encounter an error on line 6 because there is no way to choose $v$. Let $|V| = 2$. Since $G$ is connected, there must be an edge between $u$ and $v$, and it is trivially of minimum weight. They are joined, and $|G'.V| = 1 = |V| / 2$.\n\n\nSuppose the claim holds for $|V| = n$. Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n + 1$ vertices. Then $G'.V \\le n / 2$ prior to the final vertex $v$ being examined in the for-loop of line 4. If $v$ is marked then we're done, and if $v$ isn't marked then we'll connect it to some other vertex, which must be marked since $v$ is the last to be processed.\n\n\nEither way, $v$ can't contribute an additional vertex to $G'.V$. so\n\n\n$$|G'.V| \\le n / 2 \\le (n + 1) / 2.$$\n\n\nc.\n Rather than using the disjoint set structures of chapter 21, we can simply use an array to keep track of which component a vertex is in. Let $A$ be an array of length $|V|$ such that $A[u] = v$ if $v = \\text{FIND-SET}(u)$. Then $\\text{FIND-SET}(u)$ can now be replaced with $A[u]$ and $\\text{UNION}(u, v)$ can be replaced by $A[v] = A[u]$. Since these operations run in constant time, the runtime is $O(E)$.\n\n\nd.\n The number of edges in the output is monotonically decreasing, so each call is $O(E)$. Thus, $k$ calls take $O(kE)$ time.\n\n\ne.\n The runtime of Prim's algorithm is $O(E + V\\lg V)$. Each time we run $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$, we cut the number of vertices at least in half. Thus, after $k$ calls, the number of vertices is at most $|V| / 2^k$. We need to minimize\n\n\n$$E + V / 2^k\\lg(V / 2^k) + kE = E + \\frac{V\\lg V}{2^k} - \\frac{Vk}{2^k} + kE$$\n\n\nwith respect to $k$. If we choose $k = \\lg\\lg V$ then we achieve the overall running time of $O(E\\lg\\lg V)$ as desired. \n\n\nTo see that this value of $k$ minimizes, note that the $\\frac{Vk}{2^k}$ term is always less than the $kE$ term since $E \\ge V$. As $k$ decreases, the contribution of $kE$ decreases, and the contribution of $\\frac{V\\lg V}{2^k}$ increases. Thus, we need to find the value of $k$ which makes them approximately equal in the worst case, when $E = V$. To do this, we set $\\frac{\\lg V}{2^k} = k$. Solving this exactly would involve the Lambert W function, but the nicest elementary function which gets close is $k = \\lg\\lg V$.\n\n\nf.\n We simply set up the inequality\n\n\n$$E\\lg\\lg V < E + V\\lg V$$\n\n\nto find that we need\n\n\n$$E < \\frac{V\\lg V}{\\lg\\lg V-1} = O(\\frac{V\\lg V}{\\lg\\lg V}).$$",

In the remaining parts, we will show how to find a bottleneck spanning tree in linear time.\n\n\nb.\n Give a linear-time algorithm that given a graph $G$ and an integer $b$, determines whether the value of the bottleneck spanning tree is at most $b$.\n\n\nc.\n Use your algorithm for part (b) as a subroutine in a linear-time algorithm for the bottleneck-spanning-tree problem.

Suppose that $T$ is a minimum spanning tree. Suppose there is some edge in it $(u, v)$ that has a weight that's greater than the weight of the bottleneck spanning tree. Then, let $V_1$ be the subset of vertices of $V$ that are reachable from $u$ in $T$, without going though $v$. Define $V_2$ symmetrically. Then, consider the cut that separates $V_1$ from $V_2$. The only edge that we could add across this cut is the one of minimum weight, so we know that there are no edge across this cut of weight less than $w(u, v)$.\n\n\nHowever, we have that there is a bottleneck spanning tree with less than that weight. This is a contradiction because a bottleneck spanning tree, since it is a spanning tree, must have an edge across this cut.\n\n\nb.\n To do this, we first process the entire graph, and remove any edges that have weight greater than $b$. If the remaining graph is selected, we can just arbitrarily select any tree in it, and it will be a bottleneck spanning tree of weight at most $b$. Testing connectivity of a graph can be done in linear time by running a breadth first search and then making sure that no vertices remain white at the end.\n\n\nc.\n Write down all of the edge weights of vertices. Use the algorithm from section 9.3 to find the median of this list of numbers in time $O(E)$. Then, run the procedure from part b with this median value as the one that you are testing for there to be a bottleneck spanning tree with weight at most. Then there are two cases: \n\n\nFirst, we could have that there is a bottleneck spanning tree with weight at most this median. Then just throw the edges with weight more than the median, and repeat the procedure on this new graph with half the edges.\n\n\nSecond, we could have that there is no bottleneck spanning tree with at most that weight. Then, we should run the procedure from problem 23-2 to contract all of the edges that have weight at most this median weight. This takes time $O(E\\lg\\lg V)$ and then we are left solving the problem on a graph that now has half the vertices.",

To see this, we'll show that we never remove an edge which must be part of a minimum spanning tree. If we remove $e$, then $e$ cannot be a bridge, which means that e lies on a simple cycle of the graph. Since we remove edges in nonincreasing order, the weight of every edge on the cycle must be less than or equal to that of $e$. By exercise 23.1-5, there is a minimum spanning tree on $G$ with edge $e$ removed.\n\n\nTo implement this, we begin by sorting the edges in $O(E \\lg E)$ time. For each edge we need to check whether or not $T - {e}$ is connected, so we'll need to run a $\\text{DFS}$. Each one takes $O(V + E)$, so doing this for all edges takes $O(E(V + E))$. This dominates the running time, so the total time is $O(E^2)$.\n\n\nb.\n This doesn't return an $\\text{MST}$. To see this, let $G$ be the graph on 3 vertices $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let the eges be $(a, b)$, $(b, c)$, and $(c, a)$ with weights $3, 2$, and $1$ respectively. If the algorithm examines the edges in their order listed, it will take the two heaviest edges instead of the two lightest. \n\n\nAn efficient implementation will use disjoint sets to keep track of connected components, as in $\\text{MST-REDUCE}$ in problem 23-2. Trying to union within the same component will create a cycle. Since we make $|V|$ calls to $\\text{MAKESET}$ and at most $3|E|$ calls to $\\text{FIND-SET}$ and $\\text{UNION}$, the runtime is $O(E\\alpha(V))$.\n\n\nc.\n This does return an $\\text{MST}$. To see this, we simply quote the result from exercise 23.1-5. The only edges we remove are the edges of maximum weight on some cycle, and there always exists a minimum spanning tree which doesn't include these edges. Moreover, if we remove an edge from every cycle then the resulting graph cannot have any cycles, so it must be a tree.\n\n\nTo implement this, we use the approach taken in part (b), except now we also need to find the maximum weight edge on a cycle. For each edge which introduces a cycle we can perform a $\\text{DFS}$ to find the cycle and max weight edge. Since the tree at that time has at most one cycle, it has at most $|V|$ edges, so we can run $\\text{DFS}$ in $O(V)$. The runtime is thus $O(EV)$.",

Otherwise there would be an edge pointing from a later vertex to an earlier vertex in the ordering, a contradiction. Thus, the body of the for-loop of line 4 is never entered for this final vertex, so we may as well not consider it.\n\n\n24.2-3\n\n\n\n\nThe PERT chart formulation given above is somewhat unnatural. In a more natural structure, vertices would represent jobs and edges would represent sequencing constraints; that is, edge $(u, v)$ would indicate that job $u$ must be performed before job $v$. We would then assign weights to vertices, not edges. Modify the $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ procedure so that it finds a longest path in a directed acyclic graph with weighted vertices in linear time.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of modifying the $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ procedure, we'll modify the structure of the graph so that we can run $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ on it. In fact, we'll give two ways to transform a PERT chart $G = (V, E)$ with weights on vertices to a PERT chart $G' = (V', E')$ with weights on edges. In each way, we'll have that $|V'| \\le 2|V|$ and $|E'| \\le |V| + |E|$. We can then run on $G'$ the same algorithm to find a longest path through a dag as is given in Section 24.2 of the text.\n\n\nIn the first way, we transform each vertex $v \\in V$ into two vertices $v'$ and $v''$ in $V'$. All edges in $E$ that enter $v$ will enter $v'$ in $E'$, and all edges in $E$ that leave $v$ will leave $v''$ in $E'$. In other words, if $(u, v) \\in E$, then $(u'', v') \\in E'$. All such edges have weight $0$. We also put edges $(v', v'')$ into $E'$ for all vertices $v \\in V$, and these edges are given the weight of the corresponding vertex $v$ in $G$. Thus, $|V'| = 2|V|$, $|E'| = |V| + |E|$, and the edge weight of each path in $G'$ equals the vertex weight of the corresponding path in $G$.\n\n\nIn the second way, we leave vertices in $V$ alone, but we add one new source vertex $s$ to $V'$, so that $V' = V \\cup {s}$. All edges of $E$ are in $E'$, and $E'$ also includes an edge $(s, v)$ for every vertex $v \\in V$ that has $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G$. Thus, the only vertex with $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G'$ is the new source $s$. The weight of edge $(u, v) \\in E'$ is the weight of vertex $v$ in $G$. In other words, the weight of each entering edge in $G'$ is the weight of the vertex it enters in $G$. In effect, we have ''pushed back'' the weight of each vertex onto the edges that enter it. Here, $|V'| = |V| + 1$, $|E'| \\le |V| + |E|$ (since no more than $|V|$ vertices have $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G$), and again the edge weight of each path in $G'$ equals the vertex weight of the corresponding path in $G$.\n\n\n24.2-4\n\n\n\n\nGive an efficient algorithm to count the total number of paths in a directed acyclic graph.

Assume that initial we have $v.paths = 0$ for all $v \\in V$. Since all vertices adjacent to $u$ occur later in the topological sort and the final vertex has no neighbors, line 4 is well-defined. Topological sort takes $O(V + E)$ and the nested for-loops take $O(V + E)$ so the total runtime is $O(V + E)$.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nPATHS\n(\nG\n)\n\n    \ntopologically\n \nsort\n \nthe\n \nvertices\n \nof\n \nG\n\n    \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nu\n,\n \ntaken\n \nin\n \nreverse\n \ntopologically\n \nsorted\n \norder\n\n        \nfor\n \neach\n \nvertex\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\nu\n]\n\n            \nu\n.\npaths\n \n=\n \nu\n.\npaths\n \n+\n \n1\n \n+\n \nv\n.\npaths",

            "text": "The PERT chart formulation given above is somewhat unnatural. In a more natural structure, vertices would represent jobs and edges would represent sequencing constraints; that is, edge $(u, v)$ would indicate that job $u$ must be performed before job $v$. We would then assign weights to vertices, not edges. Modify the $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ procedure so that it finds a longest path in a directed acyclic graph with weighted vertices in linear time.   Instead of modifying the $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ procedure, we'll modify the structure of the graph so that we can run $\\text{DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ on it. In fact, we'll give two ways to transform a PERT chart $G = (V, E)$ with weights on vertices to a PERT chart $G' = (V', E')$ with weights on edges. In each way, we'll have that $|V'| \\le 2|V|$ and $|E'| \\le |V| + |E|$. We can then run on $G'$ the same algorithm to find a longest path through a dag as is given in Section 24.2 of the text.  In the first way, we transform each vertex $v \\in V$ into two vertices $v'$ and $v''$ in $V'$. All edges in $E$ that enter $v$ will enter $v'$ in $E'$, and all edges in $E$ that leave $v$ will leave $v''$ in $E'$. In other words, if $(u, v) \\in E$, then $(u'', v') \\in E'$. All such edges have weight $0$. We also put edges $(v', v'')$ into $E'$ for all vertices $v \\in V$, and these edges are given the weight of the corresponding vertex $v$ in $G$. Thus, $|V'| = 2|V|$, $|E'| = |V| + |E|$, and the edge weight of each path in $G'$ equals the vertex weight of the corresponding path in $G$.  In the second way, we leave vertices in $V$ alone, but we add one new source vertex $s$ to $V'$, so that $V' = V \\cup {s}$. All edges of $E$ are in $E'$, and $E'$ also includes an edge $(s, v)$ for every vertex $v \\in V$ that has $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G$. Thus, the only vertex with $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G'$ is the new source $s$. The weight of edge $(u, v) \\in E'$ is the weight of vertex $v$ in $G$. In other words, the weight of each entering edge in $G'$ is the weight of the vertex it enters in $G$. In effect, we have ''pushed back'' the weight of each vertex onto the edges that enter it. Here, $|V'| = |V| + 1$, $|E'| \\le |V| + |E|$ (since no more than $|V|$ vertices have $in\\text-degree$ $0$ in $G$), and again the edge weight of each path in $G'$ equals the vertex weight of the corresponding path in $G$.",

If $u$ is not reachable from $s$, then $u.d = \\delta(s, u) = \\infty$. If $u$ is reachable from $s$, then there is a shortest path $p = s \\leadsto x \\to u$. When the vertex $x$ was extracted, $x.d = \\delta(s, x)$ and then the edge $(x, u)$ was relaxed; thus, $u.d = \\delta(s, u)$.\n\n\n24.3-4\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gaedel has written a program that he claims implements Dijkstra's algorithm. The program produces $v.d$ and $v.\\pi$ for each vertex $v \\in V$. Give an $O(V + E)$-time algorithm to check the output of the professor's program. It should determine whether the $d$ and $\\pi$ attributes match those of some shortest-paths tree.

Otherwise, run one pass of Bellman-Ford, i.e., relax each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ one time. If any values of $v.d$ change, then declare the output to be incorrect; otherwise, declare the output to be correct.\n\n\n\n\n24.3-5\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Newman thinks that he has worked out a simpler proof of correctness for Dijkstra's algorithm. He claims that Dijkstra's algorithm relaxes the edges of every shortest path in the graph in the order in which they appear on the path, and therefore the path-relaxation property applies to every vertex reachable from the source. Show that the professor is mistaken by constructing a directed graph for which Dijkstra's algorithm could relax the edges of a shortest path out of order.\n\n\n\n\nLet the graph have vertices $s$, $x$, $y$, $z$ and edges $(s, x)$, $(x, y)$, $(y, z)$, $(s, y)$, and let every edge have weight $0$. Dijkstra's algorithm could relax edges in the order $(s, y)$, $(s, x)$, $(y, z)$, $(x, y)$. The graph has two shortest paths from $s$ to $z: \\langle s, x, y, z \\rangle$ and $\\langle s, y, z \\rangle$, both with weight $0$. The edges on the shortest path $\\langle s, x, y, z \\rangle$ are relaxed out of order, because $(x, y)$ is relaxed after $(y, z)$.\n\n\n24.3-6\n\n\n\n\nWe are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ on which each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ has an associated value $r(u, v)$, which is a real number in the range $0 \\le r(u, v) \\le 1$ that represents the reliability of a communication channel from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$. We interpret $r(u, v)$ as the probability that the channel from $u$ to $v$ will not fail, and we assume that these probabilities are independent. Give an efficient algorithm to find the most reliable path between two given vertices.\n\n\n\n\nTo find the most reliable path between $s$ and $t$, run Dijkstra's algorithm with edge weights $w(u, v) = -\\lg r(u, v)$ to find shortest paths from $s$ in $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time. The most reliable path is the shortest path from $s$ to $t$, and that path's reliability is the product of the reliabilities of its edges.\n\n\nHere's why this method works. Because the probabilities are independent, the probability that a path will not fail is the product of the probabilities that its edges will not fail. We want to find a path $s \\overset{p}{\\leadsto} t$ such that $\\prod_{(u, v) \\in p} r(u, v)$ is maximized. This is equivalent to maximizing $\\lg(\\prod_{(u, v) \\in p} r(u, v)) = \\sum_{(u, v) \\in p} \\lg r(u, v)$, which is in turn equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{(u, v) \\in p} -\\lg r(u, v)$. (Note: $r(u, v)$ can be $0$, and $\\lg 0$ is undefined. So in this algorithm, define $\\lg 0 = -\\infty$.) Thus if we assign weights $w(u, v) = -\\lg r(u, v)$, we have a shortest-path problem.\n\n\nSince $\\lg 1 = 0$, $\\lg x < 0$ for $0 < x < 1$, and we have defined $\\lg 0 = -\\infty$, all the weights $w$ are nonnegative, and we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from $s$ in $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time.\n\n\nAlternative solution\n\n\nYou can also work with the original probabilities by running a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that maximizes the product of reliabilities along a path instead of minimizing the sum of weights along a path.\n\n\nIn Dijkstra's algorithm, use the reliabilities as edge weights and substitute\n\n\n\n\nmax (and $\\text{EXTRACT-MAX}$) for min (and $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$) in relaxation and the queue,\n\n\n$\\cdot$ for $+$ in relaxation, \n\n\n$1$ (identity for $\\cdot$) for $0$ (identity for $+$) and $-\\infty$ (identity for min) for $\\infty$ (identity for max).\n\n\n\n\nFor example, we would use the following instead of the usual $\\text{RELAX}$ procedure:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nRELAX\n-\nRELIABILITY\n(\nu\n,\n \nv\n,\n \nr\n)\n\n    \nif\n \nv\n.\nd\n \n<\n \nu\n.\nd\n\uff0e\nr\n(\nu\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n        \nv\n.\nd\n \n=\n \nu\n.\nd\n\uff0e\nr\n(\nu\n,\n \nv\n)\n\n        \nv\n.\nPI\n \n=\n \nu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis algorithm is isomorphic to the one above: it performs the same operations except that it is working with the original probabilities instead of the transformed ones.\n\n\n24.3-7\n\n\n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with positive weight function $w: E \\rightarrow \\{1, 2, \\ldots, W\\}$ for some positive integer $W$, and assume that no two vertices have the same shortest-path weights from source vertex $s$. Now suppose that we define an unweighted, directed graph $G' = (V \\cup V', E')$ by replacing each edge $(u, v) \\in E$ with $w(u, v)$ unit-weight edges in series. How many vertices does $G'$ have? Now suppose that we run a breadth-first search on $G'$. Show that the order in which the breadth-first search of $G'$ colors vertices in $V$ black is the same as the order in which Dijkstra's algorithm extracts the vertices of $V$ from the priority queue when it runs on $G$.\n\n\n\n\n$V + \\sum_{(u, v) \\in E} w(u, v) - E$.\n\n\n24.3-8\n\n\n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with nonnegative weight function $w: E \\rightarrow \\{0, 1, \\ldots, W\\}$ for some nonnegative integer $W$. Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths from a given source vertex s in $O(WV + E)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nObserve that if a shortest-path estimate is not $\\infty$, then it's at most $(|V| - 1)W$. Why? In order to have $v.d < 1$, we must have relaxed an edge $(u, v)$ with $u.d < \\infty$. By induction, we can show that if we relax $(u, v)$, then $v.d$ is at most the number of edges on a path from $s$ to $v$ times the maximum edge weight. Since any acyclic path has at most $|V| - 1$ edges and the maximum edge weight is $W$, we see that $v.d \\le (|V| - 1)W$. Note also that $v.d$ must also be an integer, unless it is $\\infty$.\n\n\nWe also observe that in Dijkstra's algorithm, the values returned by the $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ calls are monotonically increasing over time. Why? After we do our initial $|V|$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations, we never do another. The only other way that a key value can change is by a $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operation. Since edge weights are nonnegative, when we relax an edge $(u, v)$, we have that $u.d \\le v.d$. Since $u$ is the minimum vertex that we just extracted, we know that any other vertex we extract later has a key value that is at least $u.d$.\n\n\nWhen keys are known to be integers in the range $0$ to $k$ and the key values extracted are monotonically increasing over time, we can implement a min-priority queue so that any sequence of $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$, $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$, and $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operations takes $O(m + k)$ time. Here's how. We use an array, say $A[0..k]$, where $A[j]$ is a linked list of each element whose key is $j$. Think of $A[j]$ as a bucket for all elements with key $j$. We implement each bucket by a circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel, so that we can insert into or delete from each bucket in $O(1)$ time. We perform the min-priority queue operations as follows:\n\n\n\n\n$\\text{INSERT}$: To insert an element with key $j$, just insert it into the linked list in $A[j]$. Time: $O(1)$ per $\\text{INSERT}$.\n\n\n$\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$: We maintain an index $min$ of the value of the smallest key extracted. Initially, $min$ is $0$. To find the smallest key, look in $A[min]$ and, if this list is nonempty, use any element in it, removing the element from the list and returning it to the caller. Otherwise, we rely on the monotonicity property and increment $min$ until we either find a list $A[min]$ that is nonempty (using any element in $A[min]$ as before) or we run off the end of the array $A$ (in which case the min-priority queue is empty).\n\n    Since there are at most $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations, there are at most $m$ elements in the min-priority queue. We increment $min$ at most $k$ times, and we remove and return some element at most $m$ times. Thus, the total time over all $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ operations is $O(m + k)$.  \n\n\n$\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$: To decrease the key of an element from $j$ to $i$, first check whether $i \\le j$, \ufb02agging an error if not. Otherwise, we remove the element from its list $A[j]$ in $O(1)$ time and insert it into the list $A[i]$ in $O(1)$ time. Time: $O(1)$ per $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$.\n\n    To apply this kind of min-priority queue to Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to let $k = (|V| - 1)W$, and we also need a separate list for keys with value $\\infty$. The number of operations $m$ is $O(V + E)$ (since there are $|V|$ $\\text{INSERT}$ and $|V|$ $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ operations and at most $|E|$ $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operations), and so the total time is $O(V + E + VW) = O(VW + E)$.\n\n\n\n\n24.3-9\n\n\n\n\nModify your algorithm from Exercise 24.3-8 to run in $O((V + E) \\lg W)$ time. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ How many distinct shortest-path estimates can there be in $V - S$ at any point in time?)\n\n\n\n\nFirst, observe that at any time, there are at most $W + 2$ distinct key values in the priority queue. Why? A key value is either $1$ or it is not. Consider what happens whenever a key value $v.d$ becomes finite. It must have occurred due to the relaxation of an edge $(u, v)$. At that time, $u$ was being placed into $S$, and $u.d \\le y.d$ for all vertices $y \\in V - S$. After relaxing edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d \\le u.d + W$. Since any other vertex $y \\in V - S$ with $y.d < \\infty$ also had its estimate changed by a relaxation of some edge $x$ with $x.d \\le u.d$, we must have $y.d \\le x.d + W \\le u.d + W$. Thus, at the time that we are relaxing edges from a vertex $u$, we must have, for all vertices $v \\in V - S$, that $u.d \\le v.d \\le u.d + W$ or $v.d = \\infty$. Since shortest-path estimates are integer values (except for $\\infty$), at any given moment we have at most $W + 2$ different ones: $u.d$, $u.d + 1$, $u.d + 2$, $\\ldots$, $u.d + W$ and $\\infty$.\n\n\nTherefore, we can maintain the min-priorty queue as a binary min-heap in which each node points to a doubly linked list of all vertices with a given key value. There are at most $W + 2$ nodes in the heap, and so $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ runs in $O(\\lg W)$ time. To perform $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$, we need to be able to find the heap node corresponding to a given key in $O(\\lg W)$ time. We can do so in $O(1)$ time as follows. First, keep a pointer $inf$ to the node containing all the $\\infty$ keys. Second, maintain an array $loc[0..W]$, where $loc[i]$ points to the unique heap entry whose key value is congruent to $i(\\mod(W + 1))$. As keys move around in the heap, we can update this array in $O(1)$ time per movement.\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of using a binary min-heap, we could use a red-black tree. Now $\\text{INSERT}$, $\\text{DELETE}$, $\\text{MINIMUM}$, and $\\text{SEARCH}$\u2014from which we can construct the priority-queue operations\u2014each run in $O(\\lg W)$ time.\n\n\n24.3-10\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we are given a weighted, directed graph $G = (V, E)$ in which edges that leave the source vertex $s$ may have negative weights, all other edge weights are nonnegative, and there are no negative-weight cycles. Argue that Dijkstra's algorithm correctly finds shortest paths from $s$ in this graph.\n\n\n\n\nThe proof of correctness, Theorem 24.6, goes through exactly as stated in the text. The key fact was that $\\delta(s, y) \\le \\delta(s, u)$. It is claimed that this holds because there are no negative edge weights, but in fact that is stronger than is needed. This always holds if $y$ occurs on a shortest path from $s$ to $u$ and $y \\ne s$ because all edges on the path from $y$ to $u$ have nonnegative weight. If any had negative weight, this would imply that we had ''gone back'' to an edge incident with $s$, which implies that a cycle is involved in the path, which would only be the case if it were a negative-weight cycle. However, these are still forbidden.",

We interpret $r(u, v)$ as the probability that the channel from $u$ to $v$ will not fail, and we assume that these probabilities are independent. Give an efficient algorithm to find the most reliable path between two given vertices.   To find the most reliable path between $s$ and $t$, run Dijkstra's algorithm with edge weights $w(u, v) = -\\lg r(u, v)$ to find shortest paths from $s$ in $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time. The most reliable path is the shortest path from $s$ to $t$, and that path's reliability is the product of the reliabilities of its edges.  Here's why this method works. Because the probabilities are independent, the probability that a path will not fail is the product of the probabilities that its edges will not fail. We want to find a path $s \\overset{p}{\\leadsto} t$ such that $\\prod_{(u, v) \\in p} r(u, v)$ is maximized. This is equivalent to maximizing $\\lg(\\prod_{(u, v) \\in p} r(u, v)) = \\sum_{(u, v) \\in p} \\lg r(u, v)$, which is in turn equivalent to minimizing $\\sum_{(u, v) \\in p} -\\lg r(u, v)$. (Note: $r(u, v)$ can be $0$, and $\\lg 0$ is undefined. So in this algorithm, define $\\lg 0 = -\\infty$.) Thus if we assign weights $w(u, v) = -\\lg r(u, v)$, we have a shortest-path problem.  Since $\\lg 1 = 0$, $\\lg x < 0$ for $0 < x < 1$, and we have defined $\\lg 0 = -\\infty$, all the weights $w$ are nonnegative, and we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from $s$ in $O(E + V\\lg V)$ time.  Alternative solution  You can also work with the original probabilities by running a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that maximizes the product of reliabilities along a path instead of minimizing the sum of weights along a path.  In Dijkstra's algorithm, use the reliabilities as edge weights and substitute   max (and $\\text{EXTRACT-MAX}$) for min (and $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$) in relaxation and the queue,  $\\cdot$ for $+$ in relaxation,   $1$ (identity for $\\cdot$) for $0$ (identity for $+$) and $-\\infty$ (identity for min) for $\\infty$ (identity for max).

Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths from a given source vertex s in $O(WV + E)$ time.   Observe that if a shortest-path estimate is not $\\infty$, then it's at most $(|V| - 1)W$. Why? In order to have $v.d < 1$, we must have relaxed an edge $(u, v)$ with $u.d < \\infty$. By induction, we can show that if we relax $(u, v)$, then $v.d$ is at most the number of edges on a path from $s$ to $v$ times the maximum edge weight. Since any acyclic path has at most $|V| - 1$ edges and the maximum edge weight is $W$, we see that $v.d \\le (|V| - 1)W$. Note also that $v.d$ must also be an integer, unless it is $\\infty$.  We also observe that in Dijkstra's algorithm, the values returned by the $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ calls are monotonically increasing over time. Why? After we do our initial $|V|$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations, we never do another. The only other way that a key value can change is by a $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operation. Since edge weights are nonnegative, when we relax an edge $(u, v)$, we have that $u.d \\le v.d$. Since $u$ is the minimum vertex that we just extracted, we know that any other vertex we extract later has a key value that is at least $u.d$.  When keys are known to be integers in the range $0$ to $k$ and the key values extracted are monotonically increasing over time, we can implement a min-priority queue so that any sequence of $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$, $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$, and $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operations takes $O(m + k)$ time. Here's how. We use an array, say $A[0..k]$, where $A[j]$ is a linked list of each element whose key is $j$. Think of $A[j]$ as a bucket for all elements with key $j$. We implement each bucket by a circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel, so that we can insert into or delete from each bucket in $O(1)$ time. We perform the min-priority queue operations as follows:   $\\text{INSERT}$: To insert an element with key $j$, just insert it into the linked list in $A[j]$. Time: $O(1)$ per $\\text{INSERT}$.  $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$: We maintain an index $min$ of the value of the smallest key extracted. Initially, $min$ is $0$. To find the smallest key, look in $A[min]$ and, if this list is nonempty, use any element in it, removing the element from the list and returning it to the caller. Otherwise, we rely on the monotonicity property and increment $min$ until we either find a list $A[min]$ that is nonempty (using any element in $A[min]$ as before) or we run off the end of the array $A$ (in which case the min-priority queue is empty). \n    Since there are at most $m$ $\\text{INSERT}$ operations, there are at most $m$ elements in the min-priority queue. We increment $min$ at most $k$ times, and we remove and return some element at most $m$ times. Thus, the total time over all $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ operations is $O(m + k)$.    $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$: To decrease the key of an element from $j$ to $i$, first check whether $i \\le j$, \ufb02agging an error if not. Otherwise, we remove the element from its list $A[j]$ in $O(1)$ time and insert it into the list $A[i]$ in $O(1)$ time. Time: $O(1)$ per $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$. \n    To apply this kind of min-priority queue to Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to let $k = (|V| - 1)W$, and we also need a separate list for keys with value $\\infty$. The number of operations $m$ is $O(V + E)$ (since there are $|V|$ $\\text{INSERT}$ and $|V|$ $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ operations and at most $|E|$ $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$ operations), and so the total time is $O(V + E + VW) = O(VW + E)$.",

($\\textit{Hint:}$ How many distinct shortest-path estimates can there be in $V - S$ at any point in time?)   First, observe that at any time, there are at most $W + 2$ distinct key values in the priority queue. Why? A key value is either $1$ or it is not. Consider what happens whenever a key value $v.d$ becomes finite. It must have occurred due to the relaxation of an edge $(u, v)$. At that time, $u$ was being placed into $S$, and $u.d \\le y.d$ for all vertices $y \\in V - S$. After relaxing edge $(u, v)$, we have $v.d \\le u.d + W$. Since any other vertex $y \\in V - S$ with $y.d < \\infty$ also had its estimate changed by a relaxation of some edge $x$ with $x.d \\le u.d$, we must have $y.d \\le x.d + W \\le u.d + W$. Thus, at the time that we are relaxing edges from a vertex $u$, we must have, for all vertices $v \\in V - S$, that $u.d \\le v.d \\le u.d + W$ or $v.d = \\infty$. Since shortest-path estimates are integer values (except for $\\infty$), at any given moment we have at most $W + 2$ different ones: $u.d$, $u.d + 1$, $u.d + 2$, $\\ldots$, $u.d + W$ and $\\infty$.  Therefore, we can maintain the min-priorty queue as a binary min-heap in which each node points to a doubly linked list of all vertices with a given key value. There are at most $W + 2$ nodes in the heap, and so $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ runs in $O(\\lg W)$ time. To perform $\\text{DECREASE-KEY}$, we need to be able to find the heap node corresponding to a given key in $O(\\lg W)$ time. We can do so in $O(1)$ time as follows. First, keep a pointer $inf$ to the node containing all the $\\infty$ keys. Second, maintain an array $loc[0..W]$, where $loc[i]$ points to the unique heap entry whose key value is congruent to $i(\\mod(W + 1))$. As keys move around in the heap, we can update this array in $O(1)$ time per movement.  Alternatively, instead of using a binary min-heap, we could use a red-black tree.

Explain how this fact might come in handy if the algorithm is used to schedule construction jobs.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the Bellman-Ford algorithm run on the graph whose construction is described in this section causes the quantity $\\max{x_i} - \\min{x_i}$ to be minimized. We know that the largest value assigned to any of the vertices in the constraint graph is a $0$. It is clear that it won't be greater than zero, since just the single edge path to each of the vertices has cost zero. We also know that we cannot have every vertex having a shortest path with negative weight. To see this, notice that this would mean that the pointer for each vertex has it's $p$ value going to some other vertex that is not the source. This means that if we follow the procedure for reconstructing the shortest path for any of the vertices, we have that it can never get back to the source, a contradiction to the fact that it is a shortest path from the source to that vertex.\n\n\nNext, we note that when we run Bellman-Ford, we are maximizing $\\min{x_i}$.

The only new constraints beyond those in the text are those involving $x_0$. For constraints $x_i \\le b_k$, we use $x_i - x_0 \\le b_k$. By the triangle inequality, $\\delta(v_0, v_i) \\le \\delta(v_0, v_0) + w(v_0, v_i) = b_k$, and so $x_i \\le b_k$. For constraints $x_i \\le b_k$, we use $x_0 - x_i \\le b_k$. By the triangle inequality, $0 = \\delta(v_0, v_0) \\le \\delta(v_0, v_i) + w(v_i, v_0)$; thus, $0 \\le x_i + b_k$ or, equivalently, $-x_i \\le b_k$.\n\n\nIf $\\delta(v_0, v_0) < 0$, so that $x_0 < 0$, then there is a negative-weight cycle containing $v_0$. The portion of the proof of Theorem 24.9 that deals with negative-weight cycles carries through but with $v_0$ on the negative-weight cycle, and we see that there is no feasible solution.\n\n\n24.4-11\n\n\n\n\nGive an efficient algorithm to solve a system $Ax \\le b$ of difference constraints when all of the elements of $b$ are real-valued and all of the unknowns $x_i$ must be integers.\n\n\n\n\nTo do this, just take the floor of (largest integer that is less than or equal to) each of the $b$ values and solve the resulting integer difference problem.

Then, there is a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ of $s$, $u$, $v$ and a shortest path from $s$ to $u$ of $s$ $v$, $u$. Based off of these, we could set $v.\\pi = u$ and $u.\\pi = v$. This then means that there is a cycle consisting of $u, v$ in $G_\\pi$.\n\n\n24.5-6\n\n\n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, directed graph with weight function $w: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ and no negative-weight cycles. Let $s \\in V$ be the source vertex, and let $G$ be initialized by $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}(G, s)$. Prove that for every vertex $v \\in V_\\pi$, there exists a path from $s$ to $v$ in $G_\\pi$ and that this property is maintained as an invariant over any sequence of relaxations.\n\n\n\n\nWe will prove this by induction on the number of relaxations performed. For the base-case, we have just called $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}(G, s)$. The only vertex in $V_\\pi$ is $s$, and there is trivially a path from $s$ to itself. Now suppose that after any sequence of $n$ relaxations, for every vertex $v \\in V_\\pi$ there exists a path from $s$ to $v$ in $G_\\pi$. Consider the $(n + 1)$th relaxation. Suppose it is such that $v.d > u.d + w(u, v)$. When we relax $v$, we update $v.\\pi = u.\\pi$. By the induction hypothesis, there was a path from $s$ to $u$ in $G_\\pi$. Now $v$ is in $V_\\pi$, and the path from $s$ to $u$, followed by the edge $(u,v) = (v.\\pi, v)$ is a path from s to $v$ in $G_\\pi$, so the claim holds.\n\n\n24.5-7\n\n\n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a weighted, directed graph that contains no negative-weight cycles. Let $s \\in V$ be the source vertex, and let $G$ be initialized by $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}(G, s)$.

Relax edges in $G_\\pi$ according to the order in which a BFS would visit them. Then we are guaranteed that the edges along each shortest path are relaxed in order. By the path-relaxation property, we would then have $v.d = \\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$. Since $G_\\pi$ contains at most $|V| - 1$ edges, we need to relax only $|V| - 1$ edges to get $v.d = \\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\n\n24.5-8\n\n\n\n\nLet $G$ be an arbitrary weighted, directed graph with a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source vertex $s$. Show how to construct an infinite sequence of relaxations of the edges of $G$ such that every relaxation causes a shortest-path estimate to change.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that there is a negative-weight cycle $c = \\langle v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k \\rangle$, where $v_0 = v_k$, that is reachable from the source vertex $s$; thus, $w(c) < 0$. Without loss of generality, $c$ is simple. There must be an acyclic path from $s$ to some vertex of $c$ that uses no other vertices in $c$. Without loss of generality let this vertex of $c$ be $v_0$, and let this path from $s$ to $v_0$ be $p = \\langle u_0, u_1, \\ldots, u_l \\rangle$, where $u_0 = s$ and $u_l = v_0 = v_k$. (It may be the case that $u_l = s$, in which case path $p$ has no edges.) \n\n\nAfter the call to $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}$ sets $v.d = \\infty$ for all $v \\in V - \\{s\\}$, perform the following sequence of relaxations. First, relax every edge in path $p$, in order. Then relax every edge in cycle $c$, in order, and repeatedly relax the cycle. That is, we relax the edges $(u_0, u_1)$, $(u_1, u_2)$, $\\ldots$, $(u_{l - 1}, v_0)$, $(v_0, v_1)$, $(v_1, v_2)$, $\\ldots$, $(v_{k - 1}, v_0)$, $(v_0, v_1)$, $(v_1, v_2)$, $\\ldots$, $(v_{k - 1}, v_0)$, $(v_0, v_1)$, $(v_1, v_2)$, $\\ldots$, $(v_{k - 1}, v_0)$, $\\ldots$\n\n\nWe claim that every edge relaxation in this sequence reduces a shortest-path estimate. Clearly, the first time we relax an edge $(u_{i - 1}, u_i)$ or $(v_{j - 1}, v_j)$, for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, l$ and $j = 1, 2, \\ldots, k - 1$ (note that we have not yet relaxed the last edge of cycle $c$), we reduce $u_i.d$ or $v_j.d$ from $\\infty$ to a finite value. Now consider the relaxation of any edge $(v_{j - 1}, v_j)$ after this opening sequence of relaxations. We use induction on the number of edge relaxations to show that this relaxation reduces $v_j.d$.\n\n\nBasis:\n The next edge relaxed after the opening sequence is $(v_{k - 1}, v_k)$. Before relaxation, $v_k.d = w(p)$, and after relaxation, $v_k.d = w(p) + w(c) < w(p)$, since $w(c) < 0$.\n\n\nInductive step:\n Consider the relaxation of edge $(v_{j - 1}, v_j)$. Since $c$ is a simple cycle, the last time $v_j.d$ was updated was by a relaxation of this same edge. By the inductive hypothesis, $v_{j - 1}.d$ has just been reduced. Thus, $v_{j - 1}.d + w(v_{j - 1}, v_j) < v_j.d$, and so the relaxation will reduce the value of $v_j.d$.",

Then, by converting currencies, a trader can start with $1$ U.S. dollar and buy $49 \\times 2 \\times 0.0107 = 1.0486$ U.S. dollars, thus turning a profit of $4.86$ percent.\n\n\nSuppose that we are given $n$ currencies $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ and an $n \\times n$ table $R$ of exchange rates, such that one unit of currency $c_i$ buys $R[i, j]$ units of currency $c_j$.\n\n\na.\n Give an efficient algorithm to determine whether or not there exists a sequence of currencies $\\langle c_{i_1}, c_{i_2}, \\ldots, c_{i_k} \\rangle$ such that\n\n\n$$R[i_1, i_2] \\cdot R[i_2, i_3] \\cdots R[i_{k - 1}, i_k] \\cdot R[i_k, i_1] > 1.$$\n\n\nAnalyze the running time of your algorithm.\n\n\nb.\n Give an efficient algorithm to print out such a sequence if one exists. Analyze the running time of your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\na.\n We can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm on a suitable weighted, directed graph $G = (V, E)$, which we form as follows. There is one vertex in $V$ for each currency, and for each pair of currencies $c_i$ and $c_j$, there are directed edges $(v_i, v_j)$ and $(v_j , v_i)$. (Thus, $|V| = n$ and $|E| = n(n - 1)$.)\n\n\nWe are looking for a cycle $\\langle i_1, i_2, i_3, \\ldots, i_k, i_1 \\rangle$ such that\n\n\n$$R[i_1, i_2] \\cdot R[i_2, i_3] \\ldots R[i_{k - 1}, i_k] \\cdot R[i_k, i_1] > 1.$$\n\n\nTaking logarithms of both sides of this inequality gives\n\n\n$$\\lg R[i_1, i_2] + \\lg R[i_2, i_3] + \\cdots + \\lg R[i_{k - 1}, i_k] + \\lg R[i_k, i_1] > 0.$$\n\n\nIf we negate both sides, we get\n\n\n$$(-\\lg R[i_1, i_2]) + (-\\lg R[i_2, i_3]) + \\cdots + (-\\lg R[i_{k - 1}, i_k]) + (-\\lg R[i_k, i_1]) < 0,$$\n\n\nand so we want to determine whether $G$ contains a negative-weight cycle with these edge weights.\n\n\nWe can determine whether there exists a negative-weight cycle in $G$ by adding an extra vertex $v_0$ with $0$-weight edges $(v_0, v_i)$ for all $v_i \\in V$, running $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$ from $v_0$, and using the boolean result of $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$ (which is $\\text{TRUE}$ if there are no negative-weight cycles and $\\text{FALSE}$ if there is a negative-weight cycle) to guide our answer. That is, we invert the boolean result of $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$.\n\n\nThis method works because adding the new vertex $v_0$ with $0$-weight edges from $v_0$ to all other vertices cannot introduce any new cycles, yet it ensures that all negative-weight cycles are reachable from $v_0$ .\n\n\nIt takes $\\Theta(n^2)$ time to create $G$, which has $\\Theta(n^2)$ edges. Then it takes $O(n^3)$ time to run $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$. Thus, the total time is $O(n^3)$.\n\n\nAnother way to determine whether a negative-weight cycle exists is to create $G$ and, without adding $v_0$ and its incident edges, run either of the all-pairs shortestpaths algorithms. If the resulting shortest-path distance matrix has any negative values on the diagonal, then there is a negative-weight cycle.\n\n\nb.\n Note: The solution to this part also serves as a solution to Exercise 24.1-6.\n\n\nAssuming that we ran $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$ to solve part (a), we only need to find the vertices of a negative-weight cycle. We can do so as follows. Go through the edges once again. Once we find an edge $(u, v)$ for which $u.d + w(u, v) < v.d$, then we know that either vertex $v$ is on a negative-weight cycle or is reachable from one. We can find a vertex on the negative-weight cycle by tracing back the $v$ values from $v$, keeping track of which vertices we've visited until we reach a vertex $x$ that we've visited before. Then we can trace back $v$ values from $x$ until we get back to $x$, and all vertices in between, along with $x$, will constitute a negative-weight cycle. We can use the recursive method given by the $\\text{PRINTPATH}$ procedure of Section 22.2, but stop it when it returns to vertex $x$.\n\n\nThe running time is $O(n^3)$ to run $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$, plus $O(m)$ to check all the edges and $O(n)$ to print the vertices of the cycle, for a total of $O(n^3)$ time.",

            "text": "A \nscaling\n algorithm solves a problem by initially considering only the highestorder bit of each relevant input value (such as an edge weight). It then refines the initial solution by looking at the two highest-order bits. It progressively looks at more and more high-order bits, refining the solution each time, until it has examined all bits and computed the correct solution.\n\n\nIn this problem, we examine an algorithm for computing the shortest paths from a single source by scaling edge weights. We are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with nonnegative integer edge weights $w$. Let $W = \\max_{(u, v) \\in E} \\{w(u, v)\\}$. Our goal is to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(E\\lg W)$ time. We assume that all vertices are reachable from the source.\n\n\nThe algorithm uncovers the bits in the binary representation of the edge weights one at a time, from the most significant bit to the least significant bit. Specifically, let $k = \\lceil \\lg(W + 1) \\rceil$ be the number of bits in the binary representation of $W$, and for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$, let $w_i(u, v) = \\lfloor w(u, v) / 2^{k - i} \\rfloor$. That is, $w_i(u, v)$ is the ''scaled-down'' version of $w(u, v)$ given by the $i$ most significant bits of $w(u, v)$. (Thus, $w_k(u, v) = w(u, v)$ for all $(u, v) \\in E$.) For example, if $k = 5$ and $w(u, v) = 25$, which has the binary representation $\\langle 11001 \\rangle$, then $w_3(u, v) = \\langle 110 \\rangle = 6$. As another example with $k = 5$, if $w(u, v) = \\langle 00100 \\rangle = 4$, then $w_3(u, v) = \\langle 001 \\rangle = 1$. Let us define $\\delta_i(u, v)$ as the shortest-path weight from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ using weight function $w_i$. Thus, $\\delta_k(u, v) = \\delta(u, v)$ for all $u, v \\in V$. For a given source vertex $s$, the scaling algorithm first computes the shortest-path weights $\\delta_1(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$, then computes $\\delta_2(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$, and so on, until it computes $\\delta_k(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$. We assume throughout that $|E| \\ge |V| - 1$, and we shall see that computing $\\delta_i$ from $\\delta_{i - 1}$ takes $O(E)$ time, so that the entire algorithm takes $O(kE) = O(E\\lg W)$ time.\n\n\na.\n Suppose that for all vertices $v \\in V$, we have $\\delta(s, v) \\le |E|$. Show that we can compute $\\delta(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$ in $O(E)$ time.\n\n\nb.\n Show that we can compute $\\delta_1(s, v)$ for all $v \\in V$ in $O(E)$ time. \n\n\nLet us now focus on computing $\\delta_i$ from $\\delta_{i - 1}$.\n\n\nc.\n Prove that for $i = 2, 3, \\ldots, k$, we have either $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v)$ or $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v) + 1$.

Implement the priority queue as an array $Q[0..|E| + 1]$, where $Q[i]$ is a list of vertices $v$ for which $v.d = i$. Initialize $v.d$ for $v \\ne s$ to $|E| + 1$ instead of to $\\infty$, so that all vertices have a place in $Q$. (Any initial $v.d > \\delta(s, v)$ works in the algorithm, since $v.d$ decreases until it reaches $\\delta(s, v)$.)\n\n\nThe $|V|$ $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$s can be done in $O(E)$ total time, and decreasing a $d$ value during relaxation can be done in $O(1)$ time, for a total running time of $O(E)$.\n\n\n\n\nWhen $v.d$ decreases, just add $v$ to the front of the list in $Q[v.d]$.\n\n\n$\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ removes the head of the list in the first nonempty slot of $Q$. To do $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ without scanning all of $Q$, keep track of the smallest $i$ for which $Q[i]$ is not empty. The key point is that when $v.d$ decreases due to relaxation of edge $(u, v)$, $v.d$ remains $u.d$, so it never moves to an earlier slot of $Q$ than the one that had $u$, the previous minimum. Thus $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$ can always scan upward in the array, taking a total of $O(E)$ time for all $\\text{EXTRACT-MIN}$s.\n\n\n\n\nb.\n For all $(u, v) \\in E$, we have $w_1(u, v) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, so $\\delta_1(s, v) \\le |V| - 1 \\le |E|$. Use part (a) to get the $O(E)$ time bound.\n\n\nc.\n To show that $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v)$ or $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v) + 1$, observe that the $i$ bits of $w_i(u, v)$ consist of the $i - 1$ bits of $w_{i - 1}(u, v)$ followed by one more bit. If that low-order bit is $0$, then $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v)$; if it is $1$, then $w_i(u, v) = 2w_{i - 1}(u, v) + 1$.\n\n\nNotice the following two properties of shortest paths:\n\n\n\n\nIf all edge weights are multiplied by a factor of $c$, then all shortest-path weights are multiplied by $c$.\n\n\nIf all edge weights are increased by at most $c$, then all shortest-path weights are increased by at most $c(|V| - 1)$, since all shortest paths have at most $|V| - 1$ edges.\n\n\n\n\nThe lowest possible value for $w_i(u, v)$ is $2w_{i - 1}(u, v)$, so by the first observation, the lowest possible value for $\\delta_i(s, v)$ is $2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v)$.\n\n\nThe highest possible value for $w_i(u, v)$ is $2w_{i - 1}(u, v) + 1$. Therefore, using the two observations together, the highest possible value for $\\delta_i(s, v)$ is $2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v) + |V| - 1$\n\n\nd.\n We have \n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat w_i(u, v)\n    & =   w_i(u, v) + 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, u) - 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v) \\\\\n    & \\ge 2w_{i - 1}(u, v) + 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, u) - 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v) \\\\\n    & \\ge 0.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThe second line follows from part (c), and the third line follows from Lemma 24.10: $\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v) \\le \\delta_{i - 1}(s, u) + w_{i - 1}(u, v)$.\n\n\ne.\n Observe that if we compute $\\hat w_i(p)$ for any path $p:u \\leadsto v$, the terms $\\delta_{i - 1}(s, t)$ cancel for every intermediate vertex $t$ on the path. Thus,\n\n\n$$\\hat w_i(p) = w_i(p) + 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, u) - 2\\delta_{i - 1}(s, v).$$\n\n\n(This relationship will be shown in detail in equation ($\\text{25.10}$) within the proof of Lemma 25.1.) The $\\delta_{i - 1}$ terms depend only on $u$, $v$, and $s$, but not on the path $p$; therefore the same paths will be of minimum $w_i$ weight and of minimum $\\hat w_i$ weight between $u$ and $v$.

This means that the lowest $\\sum_{i = 1}^k w(e_i)$ can be $0$. This means that no cycle can have negative weight. Also, we know that for any path from $s$ to $v$, we can make it simple by removing any cycles that occur. This means that it had a weight equal to some path that has at most $n - 1$ edges in it. Since we take the minimum over all possible number of edges, we have the minimum over all paths.\n\n\nb.\n To show that\n\n\n$$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v)}{n - k} \\ge 0,$$\n\n\nwe need to show that\n\n\n$$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v) \\ge 0.$$\n\n\nSince we have that $\\mu^* = 0$, there aren't any negative weight cycles. This means that we can't have the minimum cost of a path decrease as we increase the possible length of the path past $n - 1$. This means that there will be a path that at least ties for cheapest when we restrict to the path being less than length $n$. Note that there may also be cheapest path of longer length since we necessarily do have zero cost cycles. However, this isn't guaranteed since the zero cost cycle may not lie along a cheapest path from $s$ to $v$.\n\n\nc.\n Since the total cost of the cycle is $0$, and one part of it has cost $x$, in order to balance that out, the weight of the rest of the cycle has to be $-x$. So, suppose we have some shortest length path from $s$ to $u$, then, we could traverse the path from $u$ to $v$ along the cycle to get a path from $s$ to $u$ that has length $\\delta(s, u) + x$. This gets us that $\\delta(s, v) \\le \\delta(s, u) + x$. \n\n\nTo see the converse inequality, suppose that we have some shortest length path from $s$ to $v$. Then, we can traverse the cycle going from $v$ to $u$. We already said that this part of the cycle had total cost $-x$. This gets us that $\\delta(s, u) \\le \\delta(s, v) - x$. Or, rearranging, we have $\\delta(s, u) + x \\le \\delta(s, v)$. Since we have inequalities both ways, we must have equality.\n\n\nd.\n To see this, we find a vertex $v$ and natural number $k \\le n - 1$ so that $\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v) = 0$. To do this, we will first take any shortest length, smallest number of edges path from $s$ to any vertex on the cycle. Then, we will just keep on walking around the cycle until we've walked along $n$ edges. Whatever vertex we end up on at that point will be our $v$. Since we did not change the $d$ value of $v$ after looking at length $n$ paths, by part (a), we know that there was some length of this path, say $k$, which had the same cost. That is, we have $\\delta_n(s, v) = \\delta_k(s,v)$.\n\n\ne.\n This is an immediate result of the previous problem and part (b). Part (a) says that the inequality holds for all $v$, so, we have\n\n\n$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta(s, v)}{n - k} \\ge 0.$$\n\n\nThe previous part says that there is some $v$ on each minimum weight cycle so that\n\n\n$$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta(s, v)}{n - k} = 0,$$\n\n\nwhich means that\n\n\n$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v)}{n - k} \\le 0.$$\n\n\nPutting the two inequalities together, we have the desired equality.\n\n\nf.\n If we add $t$ to the weight of each edge, the mean weight of any cycle becomes\n\n\n$$\\mu(c) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i = 1}^k (w(e_i) + t) = \\frac{1}{k} \\Big(\\sum_i^k w(e_i) \\Big) + \\frac{kt}{k} = \\frac{1}{k} \\Big(\\sum_i^k w(e_i) \\Big) + t.$$\n\n\nThis is the original, unmodified mean weight cycle, plus $t$. Since this is how the mean weight of every cycle is changed, the lowest mean weight cycle stays the lowest mean weight cycle. This means that $\\mu^*$ will increase by $t$. Suppose that we first compute $\\mu^*$. Then, we subtract from every edge weight the value $\\mu^*$. This will make the new $\\mu^*$ equal zero, which by part (e) means that\n\n\n$$\\min_{v \\in V} \\max_{0 \\le k \\le n - 1} \\frac{\\delta_n(s, v) - \\delta_k(s, v)}{n - k} = 0.$$\n\n\nSince they are both equal to zero, they are both equal to each other.\n\n\ng.\n By the previous part, it suffices to compute the expression on the previ- ous line. We will start by creating a table that lists $\\delta_k(s, v)$ for every $k \\in {1, \\ldots, n}$ and $v \\in V$. This can be done in time $O(V(E + V))$ by creating a $|V|$ by $|V|$ table, where the $k$th row and vth column represent $\\delta)k(s, v)$ when wanting to compute a particular entry, we need look at a number of entries in the previous row equal to the in degree of the vertex we want to compute. \n\n\nSo, summing over the computation required for each row, we need $O(E + V)$. Note that this total runtime can be bumped down to $O(VE)$ by not including in the table any isolated vertices, this will ensure that $E \\in \\Omega(V)$. So, $O(V(E + V))$ becomes $O(VE)$. Once we have this table of values computed, it is simple to just replace each row with the last row minus what it was, and divide each entry by $n - k$, then, find the min column in each row, and take the max of those numbers.",

We are given one additional piece of information: for each vertex $v \\in V$, the weights of the edges along any shortest path from $s$ to $v$ form a bitonic sequence.\n\n\nGive the most efficient algorithm you can to solve this problem, and analyze its running time.\n\n\n\n\nObserve that a bitonic sequence can increase, then decrease, then increase, or it can decrease, then increase, then decrease. That is, there can be at most two changes of direction in a bitonic sequence. Any sequence that increases, then decreases, then increases, then decreases has a bitonic sequence as a subsequence.\n\n\nNow, let us suppose that we had an even stronger condition than the bitonic property given in the problem: for each vertex $v \\in V$, the weights of the edges along any shortest path from $s$ to $v$ are increasing. Then we could call $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}$ and then just relax all edges one time, going in increasing order of weight. Then the edges along every shortest path would be relaxed in order of their appearance on the path. (We rely on the uniqueness of edge weights to ensure that the ordering is correct.) The path-relaxation property (Lemma 24.15) would guarantee that we would have computed correct shortest paths from $s$ to each vertex.\n\n\nIf we weaken the condition so that the weights of the edges along any shortest path increase and then decrease, we could relax all edges one time, in increasing order of weight, and then one more time, in decreasing order of weight. That order, along with uniqueness of edge weights, would ensure that we had relaxed the edges of every shortest path in order, and again the path-relaxation property would guarantee that we would have computed correct shortest paths.\n\n\nTo make sure that we handle all bitonic sequences, we do as suggested above. That is, we perform four passes, relaxing each edge once in each pass. The first and third passes relax edges in increasing order of weight, and the second and fourth passes in decreasing order. Again, by the path-relaxation property and the uniqueness of edge weights, we have computed correct shortest paths.\n\n\nThe total time is $O(V + E\\lg V)$, as follows. The time to sort $|E|$ edges by weight is $O(E\\lg E) = O(E\\lg V)$ (since $|E| = O(V^2)$). $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}$ takes $O(V)$ time. Each of the four passes takes $O(E)$ time. Thus, the total time is $O(E\\lg V + V + E) = O(V + E\\lg V)$.",

Describe how evaluating this product corresponds to a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm (see Section 24.1).\n\n\n\n\nThe all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm in Section 25.1 computes\n\n\n$$L^{(n - 1)} = W^{n - 1} = L^{(0)} \\cdot W^{n - 1},$$\n\n\nwhere $l_{ij}^{(n - 1)} = \\delta(i, j)$ and $L^{(0)}$ is the identity matrix. That is, the entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the matrix ''product'' is the shortest-path distance from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and row $i$ of the product is the solution to the single-source shortest-paths problem for vertex $i$.\n\n\nNotice that in a matrix ''product'' $C = A \\cdot B$, the $i$th row of $C$ is the $i$th row of $A$ ''multiplied'' by $B$. Since all we want is the $i$th row of $C$, we never need more than the $i$th row of $A$.\n\n\nThus the solution to the single-source shortest-paths from vertex $i$ is $L_i^{(0)} \\cdot W^{n - 1}$, where $L_i^{(0)}$ is the $i$th row of $L^{(0)}$\u2014a vector whose $i$th entry is $0$ and whose other entries are $\\infty$.\n\n\nDoing the above ''multiplications'' starting from the left is essentially the same as the $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$ algorithm. The vector corresponds to the $d$ values in $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$\u2014the shortest-path estimates from the source to each vertex.\n\n\n\n\nThe vector is initially $0$ for the source and $\\infty$ for all other vertices, the same as the values set up for $d$ by $\\text{INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE}$.\n\n\nEach ''multiplication'' of the current vector by $W$ relaxes all edges just as $\\text{BELLMAN-FORD}$ does. That is, a distance estimate in the row, say the distance to $v$, is updated to a smaller estimate, if any, formed by adding some $w(u, v)$ to the current estimate of the distance to $u$.\n\n\nThe relaxation/multiplication is done $n - 1$ times.\n\n\n\n\n25.1-6\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we also wish to compute the vertices on shortest paths in the algorithms of this section. Show how to compute the predecessor matrix $\\prod$ from the completed matrix $L$ of shortest-path weights in $O(n^3)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nFor each source vertex $v_i$ we need to compute the shortest-paths tree for $v_i$. To do this, we need to compute the predecessor for each $j \\ne i$. For fixed $i$ and $j$, this is the value of $k$ such that $L_{i, k} + w(k, j) = L_{i, j}$. Since there are $n$ vertices whose trees need computing, $n$ vertices for each such tree whose predecessors need computing, and it takes $O(n)$ to compute this for each one (checking each possible $k$), the total time is $O(n^3)$.\n\n\n25.1-7\n\n\n\n\nWe can also compute the vertices on shortest paths as we compute the shortestpath weights. Define $\\pi_{ij}^{(m)}$ as the predecessor of vertex $j$ on any minimum-weight path from $i$ to $j$ that contains at most $m$ edges.

Modify the procedure to require only $\\Theta(n^2)$ space by using only two $n \\times n$ matrices.\n\n\n\n\nWe can overwrite matrices as we go. Let $A \\star B$ denote multiplication defined by the $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ procedure. Then we modify $\\text{FASTER-ALL-EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}(W)$. We initially create an $n$ by $n$ matrix $L$. Delete line 5 of the algorithm, and change line 6 to $L = W \\star W$, followed by $W = L$.\n\n\n25.1-9\n\n\n\n\nModify $\\text{FASTER-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ so that it can determine whether the graph contains a negative-weight cycle.\n\n\n\n\nFor the modification, keep computing for one step more than the original, that is, we compute all the way up to $L^{(2k + 1)}$ where $2^k > n - 1$. Then, if there aren't any negative weight cycles, then, we will have that the two matrices should be equal since having no negative weight cycles means that between any two vertices, there is a path that is tied for shortest and contains at most $n - 1$ edges. \n\n\nHowever, if there is a cycle of negative total weight, we know that it's length is at most $n$, so, since we are allowing paths to be larger by $2k \\ge n$ between these two matrices, we have that we would need to have all of the vertices on the cycle have their distance reduce by at least the negative weight of the cycle. Since we can detect exactly when there is a negative cycle, based on when these two matrices are different. This algorithm works. It also only takes time equal to a single matrix multiplication which is littlee oh of the unmodified algorithm.\n\n\n25.1-10\n\n\n\n\nGive an efficient algorithm to find the length (number of edges) of a minimum-length negative-weight cycle in a graph.\n\n\n\n\nRun $\\text{SLOW-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ on the graph. Look at the diagonal elements of $L^{(m)}$. Return the first value of $m$ for which one (or more) of the diagonal elements ($l_{ii}^{(m)}$) is negative. If $m$ reaches $n + 1$, then stop and declare that there are no negative-weight cycles.\n\n\nLet the number of edges in a minimum-length negative-weight cycle be $m^*$, where $m^* = \\infty$ if the graph has no negative-weight cycles.\n\n\nCorrectness\n\n\nLet's assume that for some value $m^* \\le n$ and some value of $i$, we find that $l_{ii}^{m^*} < 0$. Then the graph has a cycle with $m^*$ edges that goes from vertex $i$ to itself, and this cycle has negative weight (stored in $l_{ii}^{m^*}$). This is the minimum-length negative-weight cycle because $\\text{SLOW-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ computes all paths of $1$ edge, then all paths of $2$ edges, and so on, and all cycles shorter than $m^*$ edges were checked before and did not have negative weight. Now assume that for all $m \\le n$, there is no negative $l_{ii}^{(m)}$ element. Then, there is no negativeweight cycle in the graph, because all cycles have length at most $n$.\n\n\nTime\n\n\n$O(n^4)$. More precisely, $\\Theta(n^3 \\cdot \\min(n, m^*))$.\n\n\nFaster solution\n\n\nRun $\\text{FASTER-ALL-PAIRS-SHORTEST-PATHS}$ on the graph until the first time that the matrix $L^{(m)}$ has one or more negative values on the diagonal, or until we have computed $L^{(m)}$ for some $m > n$. If we find any negative entries on the diagonal, we know that the minimum-length negative-weight cycle has more than $m / 2$ edges and at most $m$ edges. We just need to binary search for the value of $m^*$ in the range $m / 2 < m^* \\le m$. The key observation is that on our way to computing $L^{(m)}$ , we computed $L^{(1)}, L^{(2)}, L^{(4)}, L^{(8)}, \\ldots, L^{(m / 2)}$, and these matrices suffice to compute every matrix we'll need.

Otherwise, if $m \\le 2$, then either $m = 1$ or $m = 2$, and $L^{(m)}$ is the first matrix with a negative entry on the diagonal. Thus, the correct value to return is $m$.\n\n\nIf $m > 2$, then we maintain an interval bracketed by the values $low$ and $high$, such that the correct value $m^*$ is in the range $low < m^* \\le high$.

Since $d = m / 4$, we have that $d$ is an integer power of $2$ and $d > 1 / 2$, so that $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge 0$. We also have \n\n\n(high - low) / 2 = (m - (m / 2)) / 2 = m / 4 = d.\n\n\nFinally, $L^{(m)}$ has a negative entry on the diagonal and $L^{(m / 2)}$ does not. Since $low = m / 2$ and $high = m$, we have that $low < m^* \\le high$.\n\n\nMaintenance:\n We use $high$, $low$, and $d$ to denote variable values in a given iteration, and $high'$, $low'$, and $d'$ to denote the same variable values in the next iteration. Thus, we wish to show that $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge -1$ implies $d' = 2^p$ for some integer $p' \\ge -1$, that $d = (high - low) / 2$ implies $d' = (high' - low') / 2$, and that $low < m^* \\le high$ implies $low' < m^* \\le high'$.\n\n\nTo see that $d' = 2^{p'}$, note that $d' = d / 2$, and so $d = 2^{p - 1}$. The condition that $d \\ge 1$ implies that $p \\ge 0$, and so $p' \\ge -1$.\n\n\nWithin each iteration, $s$ is set to $low + d$, and one of the following actions occurs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf $L^{(s)}$ has any negative entries on the diagonal, then $high'$ is set to s and $d'$ is set to $d / 2$. Upon entering the next iteration, \n\n\n$$(high' - low') / 2 = (s - low') / 2 = ((low + d) - low) / 2 = d / 2 = d'.$$\n\n\nSince $L^{(s)}$ has a negative diagonal entry, we know that $m^* \\le s$. Because $high' = s$ and $low'= low$, we have that $low' < m^* \\le high'$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf $L^{(s)}$ has no negative entries on the diagonal, then $low'$ is set to $s$, and $d'$ is set to $d / 2$. Upon entering the next iteration, \n\n\n$$(high' - low') / 2 = (high' - s) / 2 = (high - (low + d)) / 2 = (high - low) / 2 - d / 2 = d - d / 2 = d / 2 = d'.$$\n\n\nSince $L^{(s)}$ has no negative diagonal entries, we know that $m^* > s$. Because $low' = s$ and $high' = high$, we have that $low' < m^* \\le high'$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTermination:\n At termination, $d < 1$. Since $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge -1$, we must have $p = -1$, so that $d = 1 / 2$. By the second part of the loop invariant, if we multiply both sides by $2$, we get that $high - low = 2d = 1$. By the third part of the loop invariant, we know that $low < m^* \\le high$. Since $high - low = 2d = 1$ and $m^* > low$, the only possible value for $m^*$ is high, which the procedure returns.\n\n\nTime\n\n\nIf there is no negative-weight cycle, the first \nwhile\n loop iterates $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ times, and the total time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg n)$.\n\n\nNow suppose that there is a negative-weight cycle. We claim that each time we call $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}(L^{(low)}, L^{(d)})$, we have already computed $L^{(low)}$ and $L^{(d)}$. Initially, since $low = m / 2$, we had already computed $L^{(low)}$ in the first \nwhile\n loop. In succeeding iterations of the second \nwhile\n loop, the only way that low changes is when it gets the value of $s$, and we have just computed $L^{(s)}$. As for $L^{(d)}$, observe that $d$ takes on the values $m / 4$, $m / 8$, $m / 16$, $\\ldots$, $1$, and again, we computed all of these $L$ matrices in the first \nwhile\n loop. Thus, the claim is proven. Each of the two \nwhile\n loops iterates $\\Theta(\\lg m^*)$ times. Since we have already computed the parameters to each call of $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}$, each iteration is dominated by the $\\Theta(n^3)$-time call to $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}$. Thus, the total time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg m^*)$.\n\n\nIn general, therefore, the running time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$.\n\n\nSpace\n\n\nThe slower algorithm needs to keep only three matrices at any time, and so its space requirement is $\\Theta(n^3)$. This faster algorithm needs to maintain $\\Theta(\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$ matrices, and so the space requirement increases to $\\Theta(n^3\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$.",

Describe how evaluating this product corresponds to a Bellman-Ford-like algorithm (see Section 24.1).   The all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm in Section 25.1 computes  $$L^{(n - 1)} = W^{n - 1} = L^{(0)} \\cdot W^{n - 1},$$  where $l_{ij}^{(n - 1)} = \\delta(i, j)$ and $L^{(0)}$ is the identity matrix. That is, the entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column of the matrix ''product'' is the shortest-path distance from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, and row $i$ of the product is the solution to the single-source shortest-paths problem for vertex $i$.  Notice that in a matrix ''product'' $C = A \\cdot B$, the $i$th row of $C$ is the $i$th row of $A$ ''multiplied'' by $B$. Since all we want is the $i$th row of $C$, we never need more than the $i$th row of $A$.

Initialization:  Initially, $m$ is an integer power of $2$ and $m > 2$. Since $d = m / 4$, we have that $d$ is an integer power of $2$ and $d > 1 / 2$, so that $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge 0$. We also have   (high - low) / 2 = (m - (m / 2)) / 2 = m / 4 = d.  Finally, $L^{(m)}$ has a negative entry on the diagonal and $L^{(m / 2)}$ does not. Since $low = m / 2$ and $high = m$, we have that $low < m^* \\le high$.  Maintenance:  We use $high$, $low$, and $d$ to denote variable values in a given iteration, and $high'$, $low'$, and $d'$ to denote the same variable values in the next iteration. Thus, we wish to show that $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge -1$ implies $d' = 2^p$ for some integer $p' \\ge -1$, that $d = (high - low) / 2$ implies $d' = (high' - low') / 2$, and that $low < m^* \\le high$ implies $low' < m^* \\le high'$.  To see that $d' = 2^{p'}$, note that $d' = d / 2$, and so $d = 2^{p - 1}$. The condition that $d \\ge 1$ implies that $p \\ge 0$, and so $p' \\ge -1$.  Within each iteration, $s$ is set to $low + d$, and one of the following actions occurs:    If $L^{(s)}$ has any negative entries on the diagonal, then $high'$ is set to s and $d'$ is set to $d / 2$. Upon entering the next iteration,   $$(high' - low') / 2 = (s - low') / 2 = ((low + d) - low) / 2 = d / 2 = d'.$$  Since $L^{(s)}$ has a negative diagonal entry, we know that $m^* \\le s$. Because $high' = s$ and $low'= low$, we have that $low' < m^* \\le high'$.    If $L^{(s)}$ has no negative entries on the diagonal, then $low'$ is set to $s$, and $d'$ is set to $d / 2$. Upon entering the next iteration,   $$(high' - low') / 2 = (high' - s) / 2 = (high - (low + d)) / 2 = (high - low) / 2 - d / 2 = d - d / 2 = d / 2 = d'.$$  Since $L^{(s)}$ has no negative diagonal entries, we know that $m^* > s$. Because $low' = s$ and $high' = high$, we have that $low' < m^* \\le high'$.    Termination:  At termination, $d < 1$. Since $d = 2^p$ for some integer $p \\ge -1$, we must have $p = -1$, so that $d = 1 / 2$. By the second part of the loop invariant, if we multiply both sides by $2$, we get that $high - low = 2d = 1$. By the third part of the loop invariant, we know that $low < m^* \\le high$. Since $high - low = 2d = 1$ and $m^* > low$, the only possible value for $m^*$ is high, which the procedure returns.  Time  If there is no negative-weight cycle, the first  while  loop iterates $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ times, and the total time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg n)$.  Now suppose that there is a negative-weight cycle. We claim that each time we call $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}(L^{(low)}, L^{(d)})$, we have already computed $L^{(low)}$ and $L^{(d)}$. Initially, since $low = m / 2$, we had already computed $L^{(low)}$ in the first  while  loop. In succeeding iterations of the second  while  loop, the only way that low changes is when it gets the value of $s$, and we have just computed $L^{(s)}$. As for $L^{(d)}$, observe that $d$ takes on the values $m / 4$, $m / 8$, $m / 16$, $\\ldots$, $1$, and again, we computed all of these $L$ matrices in the first  while  loop. Thus, the claim is proven. Each of the two  while  loops iterates $\\Theta(\\lg m^*)$ times. Since we have already computed the parameters to each call of $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}$, each iteration is dominated by the $\\Theta(n^3)$-time call to $\\text{EXTEND-SHORTEST-PATHS}$. Thus, the total time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg m^*)$.  In general, therefore, the running time is $\\Theta(n^3\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$.  Space  The slower algorithm needs to keep only three matrices at any time, and so its space requirement is $\\Theta(n^3)$. This faster algorithm needs to maintain $\\Theta(\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$ matrices, and so the space requirement increases to $\\Theta(n^3\\lg\\min(n, m^*))$.",

To see this fact, we will note that having $\\pi^{(k)}_{ij} = l$ means that a shortest path from $i$ to $j$ last goes through $l$. A path that last goes through $l$ corresponds to taking a chepest path from $i$ to $l$ and then following the single edge from $l$ to $j$. However, This means that $d_{il} \\le d_{ij} - w_{ij}$, which we can rearrange to get the desired inequality. We can just continue following this inequality\naround, and if we ever get some cycle, $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_c$, then we would have that $d_{ii_1} \\le d_{ii_1} + w_{i_1i_2} + w_{i_2i_3} + \\cdots + w_{i_ci_1}$. So, if we subtract the common term sfrom both sides, we get that $0 \\le w_{i_ci_1} + \\sum_{q = 1}^{c - 1} w_{i_qi_{q + 1}}$. So, we have that we would only have a cycle in the precedessor graph if we ahvt that there is a zero weight cycle in the original graph. However, we would never have to go around the weight zero cycle since the constructed path of shortest weight favors ones with a fewer number of edges because of the way that we handle the equality case in equation $\\text{(25.7)}$.\n\n\n25.2-4\n\n\n\n\nAs it appears above, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm requires $\\Theta(n^3)$ space, since we compute $d_{ij}^{(k)}$ for $i, j, k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$. Show that the following procedure, which simply drops all the superscripts, is correct, and thus only $\\Theta(n^2)$ space is required.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFLOYD\n-\nWARSHALL\n'\n(\nW\n)\n\n    \nn\n \n=\n \nW\n.\nrows\n\n    \nD\n \n=\n \nW\n\n    \nfor\n \nk\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n        \nfor\n \ni\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n            \nfor\n \nj\n \n=\n \n1\n \nto\n \nn\n\n                \nd\n[\ni\n][\nj\n]\n \n=\n \nmin\n(\nd\n[\ni\n][\nj\n],\n \nd\n[\ni\n][\nk\n]\n \n+\n \nd\n[\nk\n][\nj\n])\n\n    \nreturn\n \nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the superscripts, the computation is $d_{ij}^{(k)} = \\min(d_{ij}^{(k - 1)}, d_{ik}^{(k - 1)} + d_{kj}^{(k - 1)})$. If, having dropped the superscripts, we were to compute and store $d_{ik}$ or $d_{kj}$ before using these values to compute $d_{ij}$, we might be computing one of the following:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nd_{ij}^{(k)} & = \\min(d_{ij}^{(k - 1)}, d_{ik}^{(k)} + d_{kj}^{(k - 1)}), \\\\\nd_{ij}^{(k)} & = \\min(d_{ij}^{(k - 1)}, d_{ik}^{(k - 1)} + d_{kj}^{(k)}), \\\\\nd_{ij}^{(k)} & = \\min(d_{ij}^{(k - 1)}, d_{ik}^{(k)} + d_{kj}^{(k)}),\n\\end{align}\n\n\nIn any of these scenarios, we're computing the weight of a shortest path from $i$ to $j$ with all intermediate vertices in $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$. If we use $d_{ik}^{(k)}$, rather than $d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$, in the computation, then we're using a subpath from $i$ to $k$ with all intermediate vertices in $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$. But $k$ cannot be an \nintermediate\n vertex on a shortest path from $i$ to $k$, since otherwise there would be a cycle on this shortest path. Thus, $d_{ik}^{(k)} = d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$. A similar argument applies to show that $d_{kj}^{(k)} = d_{kj}^{(k - 1)}$. Hence, we can drop the superscripts in the computation.\n\n\n25.2-5\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we modify the way in which equation $\\text{(25.7)}$ handles equality:\n\n\n$$\n\\pi_{ij}^{(k)} =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\pi_{ij}^{(k - 1)} & \\text{ if } d_{ij}^{(k - 1)} <   d_{ik}^{(k - 1)} + d_{kj}^{(k - 1)}, \\\\\n\\pi_{kj}^{(k - 1)} & \\text{ if } d_{ij}^{(k - 1)} \\ge d_{ik}^{(k - 1)} + d_{kj}^{(k - 1)}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nIs this alternative definition of the predecessor matrix $\\prod$ correct?\n\n\n\n\nIf we change the way that we handle the equality case, we will still be generating a the correct values for the $\\pi$ matrix. This is because updating the $\\pi$ values to make paths that are longer but still tied for the lowest weight. Making $\\pi_{ij} = \\pi_{kj}$ means that we are making the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ passes through $k$ at some point. This has the same cost as just going from $i$ to $j$, since $d_{ij} = d_{ik} + d_{kj}$.\n\n\n25.2-6\n\n\n\n\nHow can we use the output of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to detect the presence of a negative-weight cycle?\n\n\n\n\nHere are two ways to detect negative-weight cycles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the main-diagonal entries of the result matrix for a negative value. There is a negative weight cycle if and only if $d_{ii}^{(n)} < 0$ for some vertex $i$:\n\n\n\n\n$d_{ii}^{(n)}$ is a path weight from $i$ to itself; so if it is negative, there is a path from $i$ to itself (i.e., a cycle), with negative weight.\n\n\nIf there is a negative-weight cycle, consider the one with the fewest vertices.  \n\n\nIf it has just one vertex, then some $w_{ii} < 0$, so $d_{ii}$ starts out negative, and since $d$ values are never increased, it is also negative when the algorithm terminates.\n\n\nIf it has at least two vertices, let $k$ be the highest-numbered vertex in the cycle, and let $i$ be some other vertex in the cycle. $d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$ and $d_{ki}^{(k - 1)}$ have correct shortest-path weights, because they are not based on negativeweight cycles. (Neither $d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$ nor $d_{ki}^{(k - 1)}$ can include $k$ as an intermediate vertex, and $i$ and $k$ are on the negative-weight cycle with the fewest vertices.) Since $i \\leadsto k \\leadsto i$ is a negative-weight cycle, the sum of those two weights is negative, so $d_{ii}^{(k)}$ will be set to a negative value. Since $d$ values are never increased, it is also negative when the algorithm terminates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, it suffices to check whether $d_{ii}^{(n - 1)} < 0$ for some vertex $i$. Here's why. A negative-weight cycle containing vertex $i$ either contains vertex $n$ or it does not. If it does not, then clearly $d_{ii}^{(n - 1)} < 0$. If the negative-weight cycle contains vertex $n$, then consider $d_{nn}^{(n - 1)}$. This value must be negative, since the cycle, starting and ending at vertex $n$, does not include vertex $n$ as an intermediate vertex. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, one could just run the normal $\\text{FLOYD-WARSHALL}$ algorithm one extra iteration to see if any of the $d$ values change. If there are negative cycles, then some shortest-path cost will be cheaper. If there are no such cycles, then no $d$ values will change because the algorithm gives the correct shortest paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.2-7\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to reconstruct shortest paths in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm uses values $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ for $i, j, k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, where $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ is the highest-numbered intermediate vertex of a shortest path from $i$ to $j$ in which all intermediate vertices are in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, k \\}$. Give a recursive formulation for $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$, modify the $\\text{FLOYD-WARSHALL}$ procedure to compute the $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ values, and rewrite the $\\text{PRINT-ALLPAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH}$ procedure to take the matrix $\\Phi = \\big(\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}\\big)$ as an input. How is the matrix $\\Phi$ like the $s$ table in the matrix-chain multiplication problem of Section 15.2?\n\n\n\n\nWe can recursively compute the values of $\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}$ by, letting it be $\\phi_{ij}^{(k - 1)}$ if $d(k) + d_{ik}^{(k)} + d_{ik}^{(k)} \\ge d_{ij}(k - 1)$, and otherwise, let it be $k$. This works correctly because it perfectly captures whether we decided to use vertex $k$ when we were repeatedly allowing ourselves use of each vertex one at a time. To modify Floyd-Warshall to compute this, we would just need to stick within the innermost for loop, something that computes $\\phi(k)$ by this recursive rule, this would only be a constant amount of work in this innermost for loop, and so would not cause the asymptotic runtime to increase. It is similar to the s table in matrix-chain multiplication because it is computed by a similar recurrence.\n\n\nIf we already have the $n^3$ values in $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ provided, then we can reconstruct the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ because we know that the largest vertex in the path from $i$ to $j$ is $\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}$, call it $a_1$. Then, we know that the largest vertex in the path before $a_1$ will be $\\phi_{ia_1}^{(a_1 - 1)}$ and the largest after $a_1$ will be $\\phi_{a_1j}^{(a_1 - 1)}$. By continuing to recurse until we get that the largest element showing up at some point is $\\text{NIL}$, we will be able to continue subdividing the path until it is entirely constructed.\n\n\n25.2-8\n\n\n\n\nGive an $O(VE)$-time algorithm for computing the transitive closure of a directed\ngraph $G = (V, E)$.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an $n$ by $n$ matrix $A$ filled with $0$'s. We are done if we can determine the vertices reachable from a particular vertex in $O(E)$ time, since we can just compute this for each $v \\in V$. To do this, assign each edge weight $1$. Then we have $\\delta(v, u) \\le |E|$ for all $u \\in V$. By Problem 24-4 (a) we can compute $\\delta(v, u)$ in $O(E)$ forall $u \\in V$. If $\\delta(v, u) < \\infty$, set $A_{ij} = 1$. Otherwise, leave it as $0$.\n\n\n25.2-9\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we can compute the transitive closure of a directed acyclic graph in $f(|V|, |E|)$ time, where $f$ is a monotonically increasing function of $|V|$ and $|E|$. Show that the time to compute the transitive closure $G^* = (V, E^*)$ of a general directed graph $G = (V, E)$ is then $f(|V|, |E|) + O(V + E^*)$.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, compute the strongly connected components of the directed graph, and look at it's component graph. This component graph is going to be acyclic and have at most as many vertices and at most as many edges as the original graph. Since it is acyclic, we can run our transitive closure algorithm on it. Then, for every edge $(S_1, S_2)$ that shows up in the transitive closure of the component graph, we add an edge from each vertex in $S_1$ to a vertex in $S_2$. This takes time equal to $O(V + E')$. So, the total time required is $\\le f(|V|, |E|) + O(V + E)$.",

A path that last goes through $l$ corresponds to taking a chepest path from $i$ to $l$ and then following the single edge from $l$ to $j$. However, This means that $d_{il} \\le d_{ij} - w_{ij}$, which we can rearrange to get the desired inequality. We can just continue following this inequality\naround, and if we ever get some cycle, $i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_c$, then we would have that $d_{ii_1} \\le d_{ii_1} + w_{i_1i_2} + w_{i_2i_3} + \\cdots + w_{i_ci_1}$. So, if we subtract the common term sfrom both sides, we get that $0 \\le w_{i_ci_1} + \\sum_{q = 1}^{c - 1} w_{i_qi_{q + 1}}$. So, we have that we would only have a cycle in the precedessor graph if we ahvt that there is a zero weight cycle in the original graph. However, we would never have to go around the weight zero cycle since the constructed path of shortest weight favors ones with a fewer number of edges because of the way that we handle the equality case in equation $\\text{(25.7)}$.",

            "text": "How can we use the output of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to detect the presence of a negative-weight cycle?   Here are two ways to detect negative-weight cycles:    Check the main-diagonal entries of the result matrix for a negative value. There is a negative weight cycle if and only if $d_{ii}^{(n)} < 0$ for some vertex $i$:   $d_{ii}^{(n)}$ is a path weight from $i$ to itself; so if it is negative, there is a path from $i$ to itself (i.e., a cycle), with negative weight.  If there is a negative-weight cycle, consider the one with the fewest vertices.    If it has just one vertex, then some $w_{ii} < 0$, so $d_{ii}$ starts out negative, and since $d$ values are never increased, it is also negative when the algorithm terminates.  If it has at least two vertices, let $k$ be the highest-numbered vertex in the cycle, and let $i$ be some other vertex in the cycle. $d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$ and $d_{ki}^{(k - 1)}$ have correct shortest-path weights, because they are not based on negativeweight cycles. (Neither $d_{ik}^{(k - 1)}$ nor $d_{ki}^{(k - 1)}$ can include $k$ as an intermediate vertex, and $i$ and $k$ are on the negative-weight cycle with the fewest vertices.) Since $i \\leadsto k \\leadsto i$ is a negative-weight cycle, the sum of those two weights is negative, so $d_{ii}^{(k)}$ will be set to a negative value. Since $d$ values are never increased, it is also negative when the algorithm terminates.     In fact, it suffices to check whether $d_{ii}^{(n - 1)} < 0$ for some vertex $i$. Here's why. A negative-weight cycle containing vertex $i$ either contains vertex $n$ or it does not. If it does not, then clearly $d_{ii}^{(n - 1)} < 0$. If the negative-weight cycle contains vertex $n$, then consider $d_{nn}^{(n - 1)}$. This value must be negative, since the cycle, starting and ending at vertex $n$, does not include vertex $n$ as an intermediate vertex.     Alternatively, one could just run the normal $\\text{FLOYD-WARSHALL}$ algorithm one extra iteration to see if any of the $d$ values change. If there are negative cycles, then some shortest-path cost will be cheaper. If there are no such cycles, then no $d$ values will change because the algorithm gives the correct shortest paths.",

Give a recursive formulation for $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$, modify the $\\text{FLOYD-WARSHALL}$ procedure to compute the $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ values, and rewrite the $\\text{PRINT-ALLPAIRS-SHORTEST-PATH}$ procedure to take the matrix $\\Phi = \\big(\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}\\big)$ as an input. How is the matrix $\\Phi$ like the $s$ table in the matrix-chain multiplication problem of Section 15.2?   We can recursively compute the values of $\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}$ by, letting it be $\\phi_{ij}^{(k - 1)}$ if $d(k) + d_{ik}^{(k)} + d_{ik}^{(k)} \\ge d_{ij}(k - 1)$, and otherwise, let it be $k$. This works correctly because it perfectly captures whether we decided to use vertex $k$ when we were repeatedly allowing ourselves use of each vertex one at a time. To modify Floyd-Warshall to compute this, we would just need to stick within the innermost for loop, something that computes $\\phi(k)$ by this recursive rule, this would only be a constant amount of work in this innermost for loop, and so would not cause the asymptotic runtime to increase. It is similar to the s table in matrix-chain multiplication because it is computed by a similar recurrence.  If we already have the $n^3$ values in $\\phi_{ij}^{(k)}$ provided, then we can reconstruct the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ because we know that the largest vertex in the path from $i$ to $j$ is $\\phi_{ij}^{(n)}$, call it $a_1$. Then, we know that the largest vertex in the path before $a_1$ will be $\\phi_{ia_1}^{(a_1 - 1)}$ and the largest after $a_1$ will be $\\phi_{a_1j}^{(a_1 - 1)}$.

Using a dummy vertex gets us around the problem of trying to compute $-\\infty + \\infty$ to find $\\hat w$.

What is the relationship between the weight functions $w$ and $\\hat w$?\n\n\n\n\nIf all the edge weights are nonnegative, then the values computed as the shortest distances when running Bellman-Ford will be all zero. This is because when constructing $G'$ on the first line of Johnson's algorithm, we place an edge of weight zero from s to every other vertex. Since any path within the graph has no negative edges, its cost cannot be negative, and so, cannot beat the trivial path that goes straight from $s$ to any given vertex. Since we have that $h(u) = h(v)$ for every $u$ and $v$, the reweighting that occurs only adds and subtracts $0$, and so we have that $w(u, v) = \\hat w(u, v)$\n\n\n25.3-4\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Greenstreet claims that there is a simpler way to reweight edges than the method used in Johnson's algorithm. Letting $w^* = \\min_{(u, v) \\in E} \\{w(u, v)\\}$, just define $\\hat w(u, v) = w(u, v) - w^*$ for all edges $(u, v) \\in E$. What is wrong with the professor's method of reweighting?\n\n\n\n\nIt changes shortest paths. Consider the following graph. $V = \\{s, x, y, z\\}$, and there are 4 edges: $w(s, x) = 2$, $w(x, y) = 2$, $w(s, y) = 5$, and $w(s, z) = -10$. So we'd add $10$ to every weight to make $\\hat w$. With $w$, the shortest path from $s$ to $y$ is $s \\to x \\to y$, with weight $4$. With $\\hat w$, the shortest path from $s$ to $y$ is $s \\to y$, with weight $15$. (The path $s \\to x \\to y$ has weight $24$.) The problem is that by just adding the same amount to every edge, you penalize paths with more edges, even if their weights are low.\n\n\n25.3-5\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we run Johnson's algorithm on a directed graph $G$ with weight function $w$. Show that if $G$ contains a $0$-weight cycle $c$, then $\\hat w(u, v) = 0$ for every edge $(u, v)$ in $c$.\n\n\n\n\nIf $\\delta(s, v) - \\delta(s, u) \\le w(u, v)$, we have\n\n\n$$\\delta(s, u) \\le \\delta(s, v) + (0 - w(u, v)) < \\delta(s, u) + w(u, v) - w(u, v) = \\delta(s, u),$$\n\n\nwhich is impossible, thus $\\delta(s, v) - \\delta(s, u) = w(u, v)$, $\\hat w(u, v) = w(u, v) + \\delta(s, u) - \\delta(s, v) = 0$.\n\n\n25.3-6\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Michener claims that there is no need to create a new source vertex in line 1 of $\\text{JOHNSON}$.

More formally, suppose that flow network $G$ contains edge $(u, v)$, and we create a new flow network $G'$ by creating a new vertex $x$ and replacing $(u, v)$ by new edges $(u, x)$ and $(x, v)$ with $c(u, x) = c(x, v) = c(u, v)$. Show that a maximum flow in $G'$ has the same value as a maximum flow in $G$.\n\n\n\n\nWe will prove that for every flow in $G = (V, E)$, we can construct a flow in $G' = (V', E')$ that has the same value as that of the flow in $G$. The required result follows since a maximum flow in $G$ is also a flow. Let $f$ be a flow in $G$. By construction, $V' = V \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $E' = (E - \\{(u, v)\\}) \\cup \\{(u, x), (x, v)\\}$. Construct $f'$ in $G'$ as follows:\n\n\n$$\nf'(y, z) =\n\\begin{cases}\nf(y, z) & \\text{if $(y, z) \\ne (u, x)$ and $(y, z) \\ne (x, v)$}, \\\\\nf(u, z) & \\text{if $(y, z) =   (u, x)$ or  $(y, z) =   (x, v)$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nInformally, $f'$ is the same as $f$, except that the flow $f(u, v)$ now passes through an intermediate vertex $x$. The vertex $x$ has incoming flow (if any) only from $u$, and has outgoing flow (if any) only to vertex $v$.\n\n\nWe first prove that $f'$ satisfies the required properties of a flow. It is obvious that the capacity constraint is satisfied for every edge in $E'$ and that every vertex in $V' - \\{u, v, x\\}$ obeys flow conservation.\n\n\nTo show that edges $(u, x)$ and $(x, v)$ obey the capacity constraint, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf(u, x) = f(u, v) & \\le c(u, v) = c(u, x), \\\\\nf(x, v) = f(u, v) & \\le c(u, v) = c(x, v). \n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe now prove flow conservation for $u$. Assuming that $u \\ne \\{s, t\\}$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(u, y)\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V' -{x}} f'(u, y) + f'(u, x) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V- {v}} f(u, y) + f(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(u, y) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) \\quad \\text{(because $f$ obeys flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFor vertex $v$, a symmetric argument proves flow conservation.\n\n\nFor vertex $x$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, x)\n    & = f'(u, x) \\\\\n    & = f'(x, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(x, y).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, $f'$ is a valid flow in $G'$.\n\n\nWe now prove that the values of the flow in both cases are equal. If the source $s$ is not in $\\{u, v\\}$, the proof is trivial, since our construction assigns the same flows to incoming and outgoing edges of $s$. If $s = u$, then\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|f'| & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V' - {x}} f'(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u) + f'(u, x) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V - {v}} f(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) + f(u, v) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) \\\\\n     & = |f|.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThe case when $s = v$ is symmetric. We conclude that $f'$ is a valid flow in $G'$ with $|f'| = |f|$.\n\n\n26.1-2\n\n\n\n\nExtend the flow properties and definitions to the multiple-source, multiple-sink problem. Show that any flow in a multiple-source, multiple-sink flow network corresponds to a flow of identical value in the single-source, single-sink network obtained by adding a supersource and a supersink, and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\nCapacity constraint: for all $u, v \\in V$, we require $0 \\le f(u, v) \\le c(u, v)$.\n\n\nFlow conservation: for all $u \\in V - S - T$, we require $\\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v)$.\n\n\n26.1-3\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a flow network $G = (V, E)$ violates the assumption that the network contains a path $s \\leadsto v \\leadsto t$ for all vertices $v \\in V$. Let $u$ be a vertex for which there is no path $s \\leadsto u \\leadsto t$. Show that there must exist a maximum flow $f$ in $G$ such that $f(u, v) = f(v, u) = 0$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\n\n\n\n\nWe show that, given any flow $f'$ in the flow network $G = (V, E)$, we can construct a flow $f$ as stated in the exercise. The result will follow when $f'$ is a maximum flow. The idea is that even if there is a path from $s$ to the connected component of $u$, no flow can enter the component, since the flow has no path to reach $t$. Thus, all the flow inside the component must be cyclic, which can be made zero without affecting the net value of the flow.\n\n\nTwo cases are possible: where $u$ is not connected to $t$, and where $u$ is not connected to $s$. We only analyze the former case. The analysis for the latter case is similar.\n\n\nLet $Y$ be the set of all vertices that have no path to $t$. Our roadmap will be to first prove that no flow can leave $Y$. We use this result and flow conservation to prove that no flow can enter $Y$. We shall then constuct the flow $f$, which has the required properties, and prove that $|f| = |f'|$.\n\n\nThe first step is to prove that there can be no flow from a vertex $y \\in Y$ to a vertex $v \\in V - Y$. That is, $f'(y, v) = 0$. This is so, because there are no edges $(y, v)$ in $E$. If there were an edge $(y, v) \\in E$, then there would be a path from $y$ to $t$, which contradicts how we defined the set $Y$.\n\n\nWe will now prove that $f'(v, y) = 0$, too. We will do so by applying flow conservation to each vertex in $Y$ and taking the sum over $Y$. By flow conservation, we have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(y, v) = \\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(v, y).$$\n\n\nPartitioning $V$ into $Y$ and $V - Y$ gives\n\n\n$$\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V - Y} f'(y, v) + \\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(y, v) = \\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V - Y} f'(v, y) + \\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in Y} f'(v, y). \\tag{*}$$\n\n\nBut we also have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in Y} f'(y, v) = \\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in Y} f'(v, y),$$\n\n\nsince the left-hand side is the same as the right-hand side, except for a change of variable names $v$ and $y$. We also have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V - Y} f'(y, v) = 0,$$\n\n\nsince $f'(y, v) = 0$ for each $y \\in Y$ and $v \\in V - Y$. Thus, equation $(*)$ simplifies to\n\n\n$$\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\sum_{v \\in V - Y} f'(v, y) = 0.$$\n\n\nBecause the flow function is nonnegative, $f(v, y) = 0$ for each $v \\in V$ and $y \\in Y$. We conclude that there can be no flow between any vertex in $Y$ and any vertex in $V - Y$.\n\n\nThe same technique can show that if there is a path from $u$ to $t$ but not from $s$ to $u$, and we define $Z$ as the set of vertices that do not have have a path from $s$ to $u$, then there can be no flow between any vertex in $Z$ and any vertex in $V - Z$. Let $X = Y \\cup Z$. We thus have $f'(v, x) = f'(x, v) = 0$ if $x \\in X$ and $v \\ne X$.\n\n\nWe are now ready to construct flow $f$:\n\n\n$$\nf(u, v) =\n\\begin{cases}\nf'(u, v) & \\text{if $u, v \\ne X$}, \\\\\n0        & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nWe note that $f$ satisfies the requirements of the exercise. We now prove that $f$ also satisfies the requirements of a flow function.\n\n\nThe capacity constraint is satisfied, since whenever $f(u, v) = f'(u, v)$, we have $f(u, v) = f'(u, v) \\le c(u, v)$ and whenever $f(u, v) = 0$, we have $f(u, v) = 0 \\le c(u, v)$.\n\n\nFor flow conservation, let $x$ be some vertex other than $s$ or $t$. If $x \\in X$, then from the construction of $f$, we have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{v \\in V} f(x, v) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, x) = 0.$$\n\n\nOtherwise, if $x \\ne X$, note that $f(x, v) = f'(x, v)$ and $f(v, x) = f'(v, x)$ for all vertices $v \\in V$. Thus,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{v \\in V} f(x, v)\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(x, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(v, x) \\quad \\text{(because $f'$ obeys flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, x).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFinally, we prove that the value of the flow remains the same. Since $s \\ne X$, we have $f(s, v) = f'(s, v)$ and $f(v, x) = f'(v, x)$ for all vertices $v \\in V$, and so\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|f| & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(s, v) - \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, s) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(s, v) - \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(v, s) \\\\\n    & = |f'|.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n26.1-4\n\n\n\n\nLet $f$ be a flow in a network, and let $\\alpha$ be a real number.

We multiply both sides of the equality for $f_1$ by $\\alpha$, multiply both sides of the equality for $f_2$ by $1 - \\alpha$, and add the left-hand and right-hand sides of the resulting equalities to get\n\n\n$$\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(v, u) = \\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(u, v).$$\n\n\nObserving that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(v, u)\n\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} \\alpha f_1(v, u) + \\sum_{v \\in V} (1 - \\alpha) f_2(v, u) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(v, u))\n\\end{align}\n\n\nand, likewise, that\n\n\n$$\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(u, v) = \\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha)f_2(u, v))$$\n\n\ncompletes the proof that flow conservation holds, and thus that flows form a convex set.\n\n\n26.1-5\n\n\n\n\nState the maximum-flow problem as a linear-programming problem.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\max & \\sum\\limits_{v \\in V} f(s, v) - \\sum\\limits_{v \\in V} f(v, s) \\\\\ns.t. & 0 \\le f(u, v) \\le c(u, v) \\\\\n     & \\sum\\limits_{v \\in V} f(v, u) - \\sum\\limits_{v \\in V} f(u, v) = 0\n\\end{array}\n\n\n26.1-6\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Adam has two children who, unfortunately, dislike each other. The problem is so severe that not only do they refuse to walk to school together, but in fact each one refuses to walk on any block that the other child has stepped on that day. The children have no problem with their paths crossing at a corner. Fortunately both the professor's house and the school are on corners, but beyond that he is not sure if it is going to be possible to send both of his children to the same school. The professor has a map of his town. Show how to formulate the problem of determining whether both his children can go to the same school as a maximum-flow problem.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a vertex for each corner, and if there is a street between corners $u$ and $v$, create directed edges $(u, v)$ and $(v, u)$. Set the capacity of each edge to $1$. Let the source be corner on which the professor's house sits, and let the sink be the corner on which the school is located. We wish to find a flow of value $2$ that also has the property that $f(u, v)$ is an integer for all vertices $u$ and $v$. Such a flow represents two edge-disjoint paths from the house to the school.\n\n\n26.1-7\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that, in addition to edge capacities, a flow network has \nvertex capacities\n. That is each vertex $v$ has a limit $l(v)$ on how much flow can pass though $v$. Show how to transform a flow network $G = (V, E)$ with vertex capacities into an equivalent flow network $G' = (V', E')$ without vertex capacities, such that a maximum flow in $G'$ has the same value as a maximum flow in $G$. How many vertices and edges does $G'$ have?\n\n\n\n\nWe will construct $G'$ by splitting each vertex $v$ of $G$ into two vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, joined by an edge of capacity $l(v)$. All incoming edges of $v$ are now incoming edges to $v_1$. All outgoing edges from $v$ are now outgoing edges from $v_2$.\n\n\nMore formally, construct $G' = (V', E')$ with capacity function $c'$ as follows. For every $v \\in V$, create two vertices $v_1$, $v_2$ in $V'$. Add an edge $(v_1, v_2)$ in $E'$ with $c'(v_1, v_2) = l(v)$. For every edge $(u, v) \\in E$, create an edge $(u_2, v_1)$ in $E'$ with capacity $c'(u_2, v_1) = c(u, v)$. Make $s_1$ and $t_2$ as the new source and target vertices in $G'$. Clearly, $|V'| = 2|V|$ and $|E'| = |E| + |V|$.\n\n\nLet $f$ be a flow in $G$ that respects vertex capacities. Create a flow function $f'$ in $G'$ as follows. For each edge $(u, v) \\in G$, let $f'(u_2, v_1) = f(u, v)$. For each vertex $u \\in V - \\{t\\}$, let $f'(u_1, u_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v)$. Let $f'(t_1, t_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, t)$.\n\n\nWe readily see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between flows that respect vertex capacities in $G$ and flows in $G'$. For the capacity constraint, every edge in $G'$ of the form $(u_2, v_1)$ has a corresponding edge in $G$ with a corresponding capacity and flow and thus satisfies the capacity constraint. For edges in $E'$ of the form $(u_1, u_2)$, the capacities reflect the vertex capacities in $G$. Therefore, for $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$, we have $f'(u_1, u_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\le l(u) = c'(u_1, u_2)$. We also have $f'(t_1, t_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, t) \\le l(t) = c'(t_1, t_2)$. Note that this constraint also enforces the vertex capacities in $G$.\n\n\nNow, we prove flow conservation. By construction, every vertex of the form $u_1$ in $G'$ has exactly one outgoing edge $(u_1, u_2)$, and every incoming edge to $u_1$ corresponds to an incoming edge of $u \\in G$. Thus, for all vertices $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow to $u_1$}\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(v, u_1) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\qquad \\text{(because $f$ obeys flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = f'(u_1, u_2) \\\\\n    & = \\text{outgoing flow from $u_1$}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFor $t_1$, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow}\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(v, t_1) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) \\\\\n    & = f'(t_1, t_2) \\\\\n    & = \\text{outgoing flow}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nVertices of the form $u_2$ have exactly one incoming edge $(u_1, u_2)$, and every outgoing edge of $u_2$ corresponds to an outgoing edge of $u \\in G$. Thus, for $u_2 \\ne t_2$,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow}\n    & = f'(u_1, u_2) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(u_2, v) \\\\  \n\n    & = \\text{outgoing flow}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nFinally, we prove that $|f'| = |f|$:\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|f'| & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(s_1, v) \\\\\n     & = f'(s_1, s_2) \\qquad \\text{(because there are no other outgoing edges from $s_1$)} \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(s, v) \\\\\n     & = |f|.\n\\end{align}",

More formally, suppose that flow network $G$ contains edge $(u, v)$, and we create a new flow network $G'$ by creating a new vertex $x$ and replacing $(u, v)$ by new edges $(u, x)$ and $(x, v)$ with $c(u, x) = c(x, v) = c(u, v)$. Show that a maximum flow in $G'$ has the same value as a maximum flow in $G$.   We will prove that for every flow in $G = (V, E)$, we can construct a flow in $G' = (V', E')$ that has the same value as that of the flow in $G$. The required result follows since a maximum flow in $G$ is also a flow. Let $f$ be a flow in $G$. By construction, $V' = V \\cup \\{x\\}$ and $E' = (E - \\{(u, v)\\}) \\cup \\{(u, x), (x, v)\\}$. Construct $f'$ in $G'$ as follows:  $$\nf'(y, z) =\n\\begin{cases}\nf(y, z) & \\text{if $(y, z) \\ne (u, x)$ and $(y, z) \\ne (x, v)$}, \\\\\nf(u, z) & \\text{if $(y, z) =   (u, x)$ or  $(y, z) =   (x, v)$}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$  Informally, $f'$ is the same as $f$, except that the flow $f(u, v)$ now passes through an intermediate vertex $x$. The vertex $x$ has incoming flow (if any) only from $u$, and has outgoing flow (if any) only to vertex $v$.  We first prove that $f'$ satisfies the required properties of a flow. It is obvious that the capacity constraint is satisfied for every edge in $E'$ and that every vertex in $V' - \\{u, v, x\\}$ obeys flow conservation.  To show that edges $(u, x)$ and $(x, v)$ obey the capacity constraint, we have  \\begin{align}\nf(u, x) = f(u, v) & \\le c(u, v) = c(u, x), \\\\\nf(x, v) = f(u, v) & \\le c(u, v) = c(x, v). \n\\end{align}  We now prove flow conservation for $u$. Assuming that $u \\ne \\{s, t\\}$, we have  \\begin{align}\n\\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(u, y)\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V' -{x}} f'(u, y) + f'(u, x) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V- {v}} f(u, y) + f(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(u, y) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) \\quad \\text{(because $f$ obeys flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u).\n\\end{align}  For vertex $v$, a symmetric argument proves flow conservation.  For vertex $x$, we have  \\begin{align}\n\\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, x)\n    & = f'(u, x) \\\\\n    & = f'(x, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(x, y).\n\\end{align}  Thus, $f'$ is a valid flow in $G'$.  We now prove that the values of the flow in both cases are equal. If the source $s$ is not in $\\{u, v\\}$, the proof is trivial, since our construction assigns the same flows to incoming and outgoing edges of $s$. If $s = u$, then  \\begin{align}\n|f'| & = \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V' - {x}} f'(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V'} f'(y, u) + f'(u, x) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V - {v}} f(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) + f(u, v) \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{y \\in V} f(u, y) - \\sum_{y \\in V} f(y, u) \\\\\n     & = |f|.\n\\end{align}  The case when $s = v$ is symmetric. We conclude that $f'$ is a valid flow in $G'$ with $|f'| = |f|$.",

We show that, given any flow $f'$ in the flow network $G = (V, E)$, we can construct a flow $f$ as stated in the exercise. The result will follow when $f'$ is a maximum flow. The idea is that even if there is a path from $s$ to the connected component of $u$, no flow can enter the component, since the flow has no path to reach $t$. Thus, all the flow inside the component must be cyclic, which can be made zero without affecting the net value of the flow.

To see that the flows form a convex set, we show that if $f_1$ and $f_2$ are flows, then so is $\\alpha f_1 + (1 - \\alpha) f_2$ for all $\\alpha$ such that $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$.  For the capacity constraint, first observe that $\\alpha \\le 1$ implies that $1 - \\alpha \\ge 0$. Thus, for any $u, v \\in V$, we have  \\begin{align}\n\\alpha f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(u, v)\n    & \\ge 0 \\cdot f_1(u, v) + 0 \\cdot (1 - \\alpha) f_2(u, v) \\\\\n    & =   0.\n\\end{align}  Since $f_1(u, v) \\le c(u, v)$ and $f_2(u, v) \\le c(u, v)$, we also have  \\begin{align}\n\\alpha f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(u, v)\n    & \\le \\alpha c(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) c(u, v) \\\\\n    & =   (\\alpha + (1 - \\alpha))c(u, v) \\\\\n    & =   c(u, v).\n\\end{align}  For flow conservation, observe that since $f_1$ and $f_2$ obey flow conservation, we have $\\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v)$ and $\\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v)$ for any $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$. We need to show that  $$\\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(v, u)) = \\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(u, v))$$  for any $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$. We multiply both sides of the equality for $f_1$ by $\\alpha$, multiply both sides of the equality for $f_2$ by $1 - \\alpha$, and add the left-hand and right-hand sides of the resulting equalities to get  $$\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(v, u) = \\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(u, v).$$  Observing that  \\begin{align}\n\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(v, u) \n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} \\alpha f_1(v, u) + \\sum_{v \\in V} (1 - \\alpha) f_2(v, u) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(v, u) + (1 - \\alpha) f_2(v, u))\n\\end{align}  and, likewise, that  $$\\alpha \\sum_{v \\in V} f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha) \\sum_{v \\in V} f_2(u, v) = \\sum_{v \\in V} (\\alpha f_1(u, v) + (1 - \\alpha)f_2(u, v))$$  completes the proof that flow conservation holds, and thus that flows form a convex set.",

            "text": "Suppose that, in addition to edge capacities, a flow network has  vertex capacities . That is each vertex $v$ has a limit $l(v)$ on how much flow can pass though $v$. Show how to transform a flow network $G = (V, E)$ with vertex capacities into an equivalent flow network $G' = (V', E')$ without vertex capacities, such that a maximum flow in $G'$ has the same value as a maximum flow in $G$. How many vertices and edges does $G'$ have?   We will construct $G'$ by splitting each vertex $v$ of $G$ into two vertices $v_1$, $v_2$, joined by an edge of capacity $l(v)$. All incoming edges of $v$ are now incoming edges to $v_1$. All outgoing edges from $v$ are now outgoing edges from $v_2$.  More formally, construct $G' = (V', E')$ with capacity function $c'$ as follows. For every $v \\in V$, create two vertices $v_1$, $v_2$ in $V'$. Add an edge $(v_1, v_2)$ in $E'$ with $c'(v_1, v_2) = l(v)$. For every edge $(u, v) \\in E$, create an edge $(u_2, v_1)$ in $E'$ with capacity $c'(u_2, v_1) = c(u, v)$. Make $s_1$ and $t_2$ as the new source and target vertices in $G'$. Clearly, $|V'| = 2|V|$ and $|E'| = |E| + |V|$.  Let $f$ be a flow in $G$ that respects vertex capacities. Create a flow function $f'$ in $G'$ as follows. For each edge $(u, v) \\in G$, let $f'(u_2, v_1) = f(u, v)$. For each vertex $u \\in V - \\{t\\}$, let $f'(u_1, u_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v)$. Let $f'(t_1, t_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, t)$.  We readily see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between flows that respect vertex capacities in $G$ and flows in $G'$. For the capacity constraint, every edge in $G'$ of the form $(u_2, v_1)$ has a corresponding edge in $G$ with a corresponding capacity and flow and thus satisfies the capacity constraint. For edges in $E'$ of the form $(u_1, u_2)$, the capacities reflect the vertex capacities in $G$. Therefore, for $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$, we have $f'(u_1, u_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\le l(u) = c'(u_1, u_2)$. We also have $f'(t_1, t_2) = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, t) \\le l(t) = c'(t_1, t_2)$. Note that this constraint also enforces the vertex capacities in $G$.  Now, we prove flow conservation. By construction, every vertex of the form $u_1$ in $G'$ has exactly one outgoing edge $(u_1, u_2)$, and every incoming edge to $u_1$ corresponds to an incoming edge of $u \\in G$. Thus, for all vertices $u \\in V - \\{s, t\\}$, we have  \\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow to $u_1$}\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(v, u_1) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\qquad \\text{(because $f$ obeys flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = f'(u_1, u_2) \\\\\n    & = \\text{outgoing flow from $u_1$}.\n\\end{align}  For $t_1$, we have  \\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow}\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(v, t_1) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) \\\\\n    & = f'(t_1, t_2) \\\\\n    & = \\text{outgoing flow}.\n\\end{align}  Vertices of the form $u_2$ have exactly one incoming edge $(u_1, u_2)$, and every outgoing edge of $u_2$ corresponds to an outgoing edge of $u \\in G$. Thus, for $u_2 \\ne t_2$,  \\begin{align}\n\\text{incoming flow}\n    & = f'(u_1, u_2) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(u_2, v) \\\\   \n    & = \\text{outgoing flow}.\n\\end{align}  Finally, we prove that $|f'| = |f|$:  \\begin{align}\n|f'| & = \\sum_{v \\in V'} f'(s_1, v) \\\\\n     & = f'(s_1, s_2) \\qquad \\text{(because there are no other outgoing edges from $s_1$)} \\\\\n     & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(s, v) \\\\\n     & = |f|.\n\\end{align}",

The min capacity of this augmenting path is $12$, so we send $12$ units along it. We perform a $\\text{BFS}$ on the resulting residual network. This gets us the path $s, v_2, v_4, t$. The min capacity along this path is $4$, so we send $4$ units along it. Then, the only path remaining in the residual network is $\\{s, v_2, v_4, v_3\\}$ which has a min capacity of $7$, since that's all that's left, we find it in our $\\text{BFS}$.

The augmenting path in part (c) cancels flow on edge $(v_3, v_2)$.\n\n\n26.2-5\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the construction in Section 26.1 that converts a flow network with multiple sources and sinks into a single-source, single-sink network adds edges with infinite capacity. Prove that any flow in the resulting network has a finite value if the edges of the original network with multiple sources and sinks have finite capacity.\n\n\n\n\nSince the only edges that have infinite value are those going from the supersource or to the supersink, as long as we pick a cut that has the supersource and all the original sources on one side, and the other side has the supersink as well as all the original sinks, then it will only cut through edges of finite capacity. Then, by Corollary 26.5, we have that the value of the flow is bounded above by the value of any of these types of cuts, which is finite.\n\n\n26.2-6\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that each source $s_i$ in a flow network with multiple sources and sinks produces exactly $p_i$ units of flow, so that $\\sum_{v \\in V} f(s_i, v) = p_i$.

Show how to convert the problem of finding a flow $f$ that obeys these additional constraints into the problem of finding a maximum flow in a single-source, single-sink flow network.\n\n\n\n\n$c(s, s_i) = p_i$, $c(t_j, t) = q_j$.\n\n\n26.2-7\n\n\n\n\nProve Lemma 26.2.\n\n\n\n\nTo check that $f_p$ is a flow, we make sure that it satisfies both the capacity constraints and the flow constraints. First, the capacity constraints. To see this, we recall our definition of $c_f(p)$, that is, it is the smallest residual capacity of any of the edges along the path $p$. Since we have that the residual capacity is always less than or equal to the initial capacity, we have that each value of the flow is less than the capacity. Second, we check the flow constraints, Since the only edges that are given any flow are along a path, we have that at each vertex interior to the path, the flow in from one edge is immediately canceled by the flow out to the next vertex in the path. Lastly, we can check that its value is equal to $c_f(p)$ because, while $s$ may show up at spots later on in the path, it will be canceled out as it leaves to go to the next vertex. So, the only net flow from s is the initial edge along the path, since it (along with all the other edges) is given flow $c_f(p)$, that is the value of the flow $f_p$.\n\n\n26.2-8\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we redefine the residual network to disallow edges into $s$. Argue that the procedure $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ still correctly computes a maximum flow.\n\n\n\n\nLet $G_f$ be the residual network just before an iteration of the \nwhile\n loop of $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$, and let $E_s$ be the set of residual edges of $G_f$ into $s$. We'll show that the augmenting path $p$ chosen by $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ does not include an edge in $E_s$. Thus, even if we redefine $G_f$ to disallow edges in $E_s$, the path $p$ still remains an augmenting path in the redefined network. Since $p$ remains unchanged, an iteration of the \nwhile\n loop of $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ updates the flow in the same way as before the redefinition. Furthermore, by disallowing some edges, we do not introduce any new augmenting paths. Thus, $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ still correctly computes a maximum flow.\n\n\nNow, we prove that $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ never chooses an augmenting path $p$ that includes an edge $(v, s) \\in E_s$. Why? The path $p$ always starts from $s$, and if $p$ included an edge $(v, s)$, the vertex $s$ would be repeated twice in the path. Thus, $p$ would no longer be a \nsimple\n path. Since $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ chooses only simple paths, $p$ cannot include $(v, s)$.\n\n\n26.2-9\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that both $f$ and $f'$ are flows in a network $G$ and we compute flow $f \\uparrow f'$. Does the augmented flow satisfy the flow conservation property? Does it satisfy the capacity constraint?\n\n\n\n\nThe augmented flow $f \\uparrow f'$ satisfies the flow conservation property but not the capacity constraint property.\n\n\nFirst, we prove that $f \\uparrow f'$ satisfies the flow conservation property. We note that if edge $(u, v) \\in E$, then $(v, u) \\ne E$ and $f'(v, u) = 0$. Thus, we can rewrite the definition of flow augmentation (equation $\\text{(26.4)}$), when applied to two flows, as\n\n\n$$\n(f \\uparrow f')(u, v) =\n\\begin{cases}\nf(u, v) + f'(u, v) & \\text{if $(u, v) \\in E$}, \\\\\n0                  & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nThe definition implies that the new flow on each edge is simply the sum of the two flows on that edge. We now prove that in $f \\uparrow f'$, the net incoming flow for each vertex equals the net outgoing flow. Let $u \\ne {s, t}$ be any vertex of $G$. We have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{v \\in V} (f \\uparrow f') (v, u)\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} (f(v, u) + f'(v, u)) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(v, u) + \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(v, u) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} f(u, v) + \\sum_{v \\in V} f'(u, v) \\quad \\text{(because $f$, $f'$ obey flow conservation)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} (f(u, v) + f'(u, v)) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{v \\in V} (f \\uparrow f') (u, v).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nWe conclude that $f \\uparrow f'$ satisfies flow conservation.\n\n\nWe now show that $f \\uparrow f'$ need not satisfy the capacity constraint by giving a simple counterexample. Let the flow network $G$ have just a source and a target vertex, with a single edge $(s, t)$ having $c(s, t) = 1$. Define the flows $f$ and $f'$ to have $f(s, t) = f'(s, t) = 1$. Then, we have $(f \\uparrow f')(s, t) = 2 > c(s, t)$. We conclude that $f \\uparrow f'$ need not satisfy the capacity constraint.\n\n\n26.2-10\n\n\n\n\nShow how to find a maximum flow in a network $G = (V, E)$ by a sequence of at most $|E|$ augmenting paths. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ Determine the paths after finding the maximum flow.)\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we already have a maximum flow $f$. Consider a new graph $G$ where we set the capacity of edge $(u, v)$ to $f(u, v)$. Run Ford-Fulkerson, with the modification that we remove an edge if its flow reaches its capacity. In other words, if $f(u, v) = c(u, v)$ then there should be no reverse edge appearing in residual network. This will still produce correct output in our case because we never exceed the actual maximum flow through an edge, so it is never advantageous to cancel flow. The augmenting paths chosen in this modified version of Ford-Fulkerson are precisely the ones we want. There are at most $|E|$ because every augmenting path produces at least one edge whose flow is equal to its capacity, which we set to be the actual flow for the edge in a maximum flow, and our modification prevents us from ever destroying this progress.\n\n\n26.2-11\n\n\n\n\nThe \nedge connectivity\n of an undirected graph is the minimum number $k$ of edges that must be removed to disconnect the graph. For example, the edge connectivity of a tree is $1$, and the edge connectivity of a cyclic chain of vertices is $2$. Show how to determine the edge connectivity of an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ by running a maximum-flow algorithm on at most $|V|$ flow networks, each having $O(V)$ vertices and $O(E)$ edges.\n\n\n\n\nFor any two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$, we can define a flow network $G_{uv}$ consisting of the directed version of $G$ with $s = u$, $t = v$, and all edge capacities set to $1$. (The flow network $G_{uv}$ has $V$ vertices and $2|E|$ edges, so that it has $O(V)$ vertices and $O(E)$ edges, as required. We want all capacities to be $1$ so that the number of edges of $G$ crossing a cut equals the capacity of the cut in $G_{uv}$.) Let $f_{uv}$ denote a maximum flow in $G_{uv}$.\n\n\nWe claim that for any $u \\in V$, the edge connectivity $k$ equals $\\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}}\\{|f_{uv}|\\}$.

We prove that $k = \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}}\\{|f_{uv}|\\}$ for any $u \\in V$ by showing separately that $k$ is at least this minimum and that $k$ is at most this minimum.\n\n\n\n\nProof that $k \\ge \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$:\n\n    Let $m = \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$. Suppose we remove only $m - 1$ edges from $G$. For any vertex $v$, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, $u$ and $v$ are still connected. (The max flow from $u$ to $v$ is at least $m$, hence any cut separating $u$ from $v$ has capacity at least $m$, which means at least $m$ edges cross any such cut. Thus at least one edge is left crossing the cut when we remove $m - 1$ edges.) Thus every vertex is connected to $u$, which implies that the graph is still connected. So at least $m$ edges must be removed to disconnect the graph\u2014i.e., $k \\ge \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$. \n\n\nProof that $k \\le \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$:\n\n    Consider a vertex $v$ with the minimum $|f_{uv}|$. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, there is a cut of capacity $|f_{uv}|$ separating $u$ and $v$. Since all edge capacities are $1$, exactly $|f_{uv}|$ edges cross this cut. If these edges are removed, there is no path from $u$ to $v$, and so our graph becomes disconnected. Hence $k \\le \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$\n\n\nThus, the claim that $k = \\min\\limits_{v \\in V - \\{u\\}} \\{|f_{uv}|\\}$ for any $u \\in V$ is true.\n\n\n\n\n26.2-12\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that you are given a flow network $G$, and $G$ has edges entering the source $s$. Let $f$ be a flow in $G$ in which one of the edges $(v, s)$ entering the source has $f(v, s) = 1$. Prove that there must exist another flow $f'$ with $f'(v, s) = 0$ such that $|f| = |f'|$. Give an $O(E)$-time algorithm to compute $f'$, given $f$, and assuming that all edge capacities are integers.\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of the proof is that if $f(v, s) = 1$, then there must exist a cycle containing the edge $(v, s)$ and for which each edge carries one unit of flow. If we reduce the flow on each edge in the cycle by one unit, we can reduce $f(v, s)$ to $0$ without affecting the value of the flow.\n\n\nGiven the flow network $G$ and the flow $f$, we say that vertex $y$ is \nflow-connected\n to vertex $z$ if there exists a path $p$ from $y$ to $z$ such that each edge of $p$ has a positive flow on it. We also define $y$ to be flow-connected to itself. In particular, $s$ is flow-connected to $s$.\n\n\nWe start by proving the following lemma:\n\n\nLemma\n \n\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a flow network and $f$ be a flow in $G$. If $s$ is not flow-connected to $v$, then $f(v, s) = 0$.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nThe idea is that since $s$ is not flow-connected to $v$, there cannot be any flow from $s$ to $v$. By using flow conservation, we will prove that there cannot be any flow from $v$ to $s$ either, and thus that $f(v, s) = 0$.\n\n\nLet $Y$ be the set of all vertices $y$ such that $s$ is flow-connected to $y$. By applying flow conservation to vertices in $V - Y$ and taking the sum, we obtain\n\n\n$$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V} f(z, x).$$\n\n\nPartitioning $V$ into $Y$ and $V - Y$ gives\n\n\n$$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(x, z) + \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(z, x) + \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(z, x). \\tag{*}$$\n\n\nBut we have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(z, x),$$\n\n\nsince the left-hand side is the same as the right-hand side, except for a change of variable names $x$ and $z$. We also have\n\n\n$$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(x, z) = 0,$$\n\n\nsince the flow from any vertex in $Y$ to any vertex in $V - Y$ must be $0$. Thus, equation $(*)$ simplifies to\n\n\n$$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(z, x) = 0.$$\n\n\nThe above equation implies that $f(z, x) = 0$ for each $z \\in V - Y$ and $x \\in Y$. In particular, since $v \\in V - Y$ and $s \\in Y$, we have that $f(v, s) = 0$.\n\n\nNow, we show how to construct the required flow $f'$. By the contrapositive of the lemma, $f(v, s) > 0$ implies that $s$ is flow-connected to $v$ through some path $p$. Let path $p'$ be the path $s \\overset{p}{\\leadsto} v \\to s$. Path $p'$ is a cycle that has positive flow on each edge. Because we assume that all edge capacities are integers, the flow on each edge of $p'$ is at least $1$. If we subtract $1$ from each edge of the cycle to obtain a flow $f'$, then $f'$ still satisfies the properties of a flow network and has the same value as $|f|$. Because edge $(v, s)$ is in the cycle, we have that $f'(v, s) = f(v, s) - 1 = 0$.\n\n\n26.2-13\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that you wish to find, among all minimum cuts in a flow network $G$ with integral capacities, one that contains the smallest number of edges. Show how to modify the capacities of $G$ to create a new flow network $G'$ in which any minimum cut in $G'$ is a minimum cut with the smallest number of edges in $G$.\n\n\n\n\nLet $(S, T)$ and $(X, Y)$ be two cuts in $G$ (and $G'$). Let $c'$ be the capacity function of $G'$. One way to define $c'$ is to add a small amount $\\delta$ to the capacity of each edge in $G$. That is, if $u$ and $v$ are two vertices, we set\n\n\n$$c'(u, v) = c(u, v) + \\delta.$$\n\n\nThus, if $c(S, T) = c(X, Y)$ and $(S, T)$ has fewer edges than $(X, Y)$, then we would have $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. We have to be careful and choose a small $\\delta$, lest we change the relative ordering of two unequal capacities. That is, if $c(S, T) < c(X, Y)$, then no matter many more edges $(S, T)$ has than $(X, Y)$, we still need to have $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. With this definition of $c'$, a minimum cut in $G'$ will be a minimum cut in $G$ that has the minimum number of edges.\n\n\nHow should we choose the value of $\\delta$? Let $m$ be the minimum difference between capacities of two unequal-capacity cuts in $G$. Choose $\\delta = m / (2|E|)$. For any cut $(S, T)$, since the cut can have at most $|E|$ edges, we can bound $c'(S, T)$ by\n\n\n$$c(S, T) \\le c'(S, T) \\le c(S, T) + |E| \\cdot \\delta.$$\n\n\nLet $c(S, T) < c(X, Y)$. We need to prove that $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. We have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nc'(S, T)\n    & \\le c(S, T) + |E| \\cdot \\delta \\\\\n    & =   c(S, T) + m / 2 \\\\\n    & <   c(X, Y) \\qquad \\text{(since $c(X, Y) - c(S, T) \\ge m$)} \\\\\n    & \\le c'(X, Y).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nBecause all capacities are integral, we can choose $m = 1$, obtaining $\\delta = 1 / 2|E|$. To avoid dealing with fractional values, we can scale all capacities by $2|E|$ to obtain\n\n\n$$c'(u, v) = 2|E| \\cdot c(u, v) + 1.$$",

Give an $O(E)$-time algorithm to compute $f'$, given $f$, and assuming that all edge capacities are integers.   The idea of the proof is that if $f(v, s) = 1$, then there must exist a cycle containing the edge $(v, s)$ and for which each edge carries one unit of flow. If we reduce the flow on each edge in the cycle by one unit, we can reduce $f(v, s)$ to $0$ without affecting the value of the flow.  Given the flow network $G$ and the flow $f$, we say that vertex $y$ is  flow-connected  to vertex $z$ if there exists a path $p$ from $y$ to $z$ such that each edge of $p$ has a positive flow on it. We also define $y$ to be flow-connected to itself. In particular, $s$ is flow-connected to $s$.  We start by proving the following lemma:  Lemma    Let $G = (V, E)$ be a flow network and $f$ be a flow in $G$. If $s$ is not flow-connected to $v$, then $f(v, s) = 0$.  Proof    The idea is that since $s$ is not flow-connected to $v$, there cannot be any flow from $s$ to $v$. By using flow conservation, we will prove that there cannot be any flow from $v$ to $s$ either, and thus that $f(v, s) = 0$.  Let $Y$ be the set of all vertices $y$ such that $s$ is flow-connected to $y$. By applying flow conservation to vertices in $V - Y$ and taking the sum, we obtain  $$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V} f(z, x).$$  Partitioning $V$ into $Y$ and $V - Y$ gives  $$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(x, z) + \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(z, x) + \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(z, x). \\tag{*}$$  But we have  $$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(x, z) = \\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in V - Y} f(z, x),$$  since the left-hand side is the same as the right-hand side, except for a change of variable names $x$ and $z$. We also have  $$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(x, z) = 0,$$  since the flow from any vertex in $Y$ to any vertex in $V - Y$ must be $0$. Thus, equation $(*)$ simplifies to  $$\\sum_{z \\in V - Y} \\sum_{x \\in Y} f(z, x) = 0.$$  The above equation implies that $f(z, x) = 0$ for each $z \\in V - Y$ and $x \\in Y$. In particular, since $v \\in V - Y$ and $s \\in Y$, we have that $f(v, s) = 0$.  Now, we show how to construct the required flow $f'$. By the contrapositive of the lemma, $f(v, s) > 0$ implies that $s$ is flow-connected to $v$ through some path $p$. Let path $p'$ be the path $s \\overset{p}{\\leadsto} v \\to s$. Path $p'$ is a cycle that has positive flow on each edge. Because we assume that all edge capacities are integers, the flow on each edge of $p'$ is at least $1$. If we subtract $1$ from each edge of the cycle to obtain a flow $f'$, then $f'$ still satisfies the properties of a flow network and has the same value as $|f|$. Because edge $(v, s)$ is in the cycle, we have that $f'(v, s) = f(v, s) - 1 = 0$.",

Show how to modify the capacities of $G$ to create a new flow network $G'$ in which any minimum cut in $G'$ is a minimum cut with the smallest number of edges in $G$.   Let $(S, T)$ and $(X, Y)$ be two cuts in $G$ (and $G'$). Let $c'$ be the capacity function of $G'$. One way to define $c'$ is to add a small amount $\\delta$ to the capacity of each edge in $G$. That is, if $u$ and $v$ are two vertices, we set  $$c'(u, v) = c(u, v) + \\delta.$$  Thus, if $c(S, T) = c(X, Y)$ and $(S, T)$ has fewer edges than $(X, Y)$, then we would have $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. We have to be careful and choose a small $\\delta$, lest we change the relative ordering of two unequal capacities. That is, if $c(S, T) < c(X, Y)$, then no matter many more edges $(S, T)$ has than $(X, Y)$, we still need to have $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. With this definition of $c'$, a minimum cut in $G'$ will be a minimum cut in $G$ that has the minimum number of edges.  How should we choose the value of $\\delta$? Let $m$ be the minimum difference between capacities of two unequal-capacity cuts in $G$. Choose $\\delta = m / (2|E|)$. For any cut $(S, T)$, since the cut can have at most $|E|$ edges, we can bound $c'(S, T)$ by  $$c(S, T) \\le c'(S, T) \\le c(S, T) + |E| \\cdot \\delta.$$  Let $c(S, T) < c(X, Y)$. We need to prove that $c'(S, T) < c'(X, Y)$. We have  \\begin{align}\nc'(S, T)\n    & \\le c(S, T) + |E| \\cdot \\delta \\\\\n    & =   c(S, T) + m / 2 \\\\\n    & <   c(X, Y) \\qquad \\text{(since $c(X, Y) - c(S, T) \\ge m$)} \\\\\n    & \\le c'(X, Y).\n\\end{align}  Because all capacities are integral, we can choose $m = 1$, obtaining $\\delta = 1 / 2|E|$. To avoid dealing with fractional values, we can scale all capacities by $2|E|$ to obtain  $$c'(u, v) = 2|E| \\cdot c(u, v) + 1.$$",

Either way, these the the sum or difference of integers by assumption, so after the $(n + 1)$th iteration we have that $(u, v).f$ is an integer for all $(u, v) \\in E$.

Give a good upper bound on the length of any augmenting path found in $G'$ during the execution of $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$.\n\n\n\n\nBy definition, an augmenting path is a simple path $s \\leadsto t$ in the residual network $G_f'$. Since $G$ has no edges between vertices in $L$ and no edges between vertices in $R$, neither does the flow network $G'$ and hence neither does $G_f'$. Also, the only edges involving $s$ or $t$ connect $s$ to $L$ and $R$ to $t$. Note that although edges in $G'$ can go only from $L$ to $R$, edges in $G_f'$ can also go from $R$ to $L$.\n\n\nThus any augmenting path must go\n\n\n$$s \\to L \\to R \\to \\cdots \\to L \\to R \\to t,$$\n\n\ncrossing back and forth between $L$ and $R$ at most as many times as it can do so without using a vertex twice.

The length of an augmenting path (i.e., its number of edges) is thus bounded above by $2 \\cdot \\min(|L|, |R|) + 1$.\n\n\n26.3-4 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nA \nperfect matching\n is a matching in which every vertex is matched. Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected bipartite graph with vertex partition $V = L \\cup R$, where $|L| = |R|$. For any $X \\subseteq V$, define the \nneighborhood\n of $X$ as\n\n\n$$N(X) = \\{y \\in V: (x, y) \\in E \\text{ for some } x \\in X\\},$$\n\n\nthat is, the set of vertices adjacent to some member of $X$. Prove \nHall's theorem\n: there exists a perfect matching in $G$ if and only if $|A| \\le |N(A)|$ for every subset $A \\subseteq L$.\n\n\n\n\nFirst suppose there exists a perfect matching in $G$. Then for any subset $A \\subseteq L$, each vertex of $A$ is matched with a neighbor in $R$, and since it is a matching, no two such vertices are matched with the same vertex in $R$. Thus, there are at least $|A|$ vertices in the neighborhood of $A$.\n\n\nNow suppose that $|A| \\le |N(A)|$ for all $A \\subseteq L$. Run Ford-Fulkerson on the corresponding flow network. The flow is increased by $1$ each time an augmenting path is found, so it will suffice to show that this happens $|L|$ times. Suppose the while loop has run fewer than $L$ times, but there is no augmenting path. Then fewer than $L$ edges from $L$ to $R$ have flow $1$. \n\n\nLet $v_1 \\in L$ be such that no edge from $v_1$ to a vertex in $R$ has nonzero flow. By assumption, $v_1$ has at least one neighbor $v_1' \\in R$. If any of $v_1$'s neighbors are connected to $t$ in $G_f$ then there is a path, so assume this is not the case. Thus, there must be some edge $(v_2, v_1)$ with flow $1$. By assumption, $N(\\{v_1, v_2\\}) \\ge 2$, so there must exist $v_2' \\ne v_1'$ such that $v_2'\\in N(\\{v_1, v_2 \\})$. If $(v_2', t)$ is an edge in the residual network we're done since $v_2'$ must be a neighbor of $v_2$, so $s$, $v_1$, $v_1'$, $v_2$, $v_2'$, and $t$ is a path in $G_f$. Otherwise $v_2'$ must have a neighbor $v_3 \\in L$ such that $(v_3, v_2')$ is in $G_f$. Specifically, $v_3 \\ne v_1$ since $(v_3, v_2')$ has flow $1$, and $v_3 \\ne v_2$ since $(v_2, v_1')$ has flow $1$, so no more flow can leave $v_2$ without violating conservation of flow. Again by our hypothesis, $N(\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}) \\ge 3$, so there is another neighbor $v_3' \\in R$.\n\n\nContinuing in this fashion, we keep building up the neighborhood $v_i'$, expanding each time we find that $(v_i', t)$ is not an edge in $G_f$. This cannot happen $L$ times, since we have run the Ford-Fulkerson while-loop fewer than $|L|$ times, so there still exist edges into $t$ in $G_f$. Thus, the process must stop at some vertex $v_k'$, and we obtain an augmenting path \n\n\n$$s, v_1, v_1', v_2, v_2', v_3, \\ldots, v_k, v_k', t,$$\n\n\ncontradicting our assumption that there was no such path. Therefore the while loop runs at least $|L|$ times. By Corollary 26.3 the flow strictly increases each time by $f_p$. By Theorem 26.10 $f_p$ is an integer. In particular, it is equal to $1$. This implies that $|f| \\ge |L|$. It is clear that $|f| \\le |L|$, so we must have $|f| = |L|$. By Corollary 26.11 this is the cardinality of a maximum matching. Since $|L| = |R|$, any maximum matching must be a perfect matching.\n\n\n26.3-5 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nWe say that a bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = L \\cup R$, is \n$d$-regular\n if every vertex $v \\in V$ has degree exactly $d$. Every $d$-regular bipartite graph has $|L| = |R|$. Prove that every $d$-regular bipartite graph has a matching of cardinality $|L|$ by arguing that a minimum cut of the corresponding flow network has capacity $|L|$.\n\n\n\n\nWe convert the bipartite graph into a flow problem by making a new vertex for the source which has an edge of unit capacity going to each of the vertices in $L$, and a new vertex for the sink that has an edge from each of the vertices in $R$, each with unit capacity. We want to show that the number of edge between the two parts of the cut is at least $L$, this would get us by the max-flow-min-cut theorem that there is a flow of value at least $|L|$. The, we can apply the integrality theorem that all of the flow values are integers, meaning that we are selecting $|L|$ disjoint edges between $L$ and $R$.\n\n\nTo see that every cut must have capacity at lest $|L|$, let $S_1$ be the side of the cut containing the source and let $S_2$ be the side of the cut containing the sink. Then, look at $L \\cap S_1$. The source has an edge going to each of $L \\cap (S_1)^c$, and there is an edge from $R \\cap S_1$ to the sink that will be cut. This means that we need that there are at least $|L \\cap S_1| - |R \\cap S_1|$ many edges going from $L \\cap S_1$ to $R \\cap S_2$. If we look at the set of all neighbors of $L \\cap S_1$, we get that there must be at least the same number of neighbors in $R$, because otherwise we could sum up the degrees going from $L \\cap S_1$ to $R$ on both sides, and get that some of the vertices in $R$ would need to have a degree higher than $d$. This means that the number of neighbors of $L \\cap S_1$ is at least $L \\cap S_1$, but we have that they are in $S_1$, but there are only $|R \\cap S_1|$ of those, so, we have that the size of the set of neighbors of $L \\cap S_1$ that are in $S_2$ is at least $|L \\cap S_1| - |R \\cap S_1|$. Since each of these neighbors has an edge crossing the cut, we have that the total number of edges that the cut breaks is at least \n\n\n$$(|L| - |L \\cap S_1|) + (|L \\cap S_1| - |R \\cap S_1|) + |R \\cap S_1| = |L|.$$\n\n\nSince each of these edges is unit valued, the value of the cut is at least $|L|$.",

To do this, we will need to maintain a list of overflowing vertices. By Lemma 26.14, a push or a relabel operation always applies to an overflowing vertex. To determine which operation to perform, we need to determine whether $u.h = v.h + 1$ for some $v \\in N(u)$. We'll do this by maintaining a list $u.high$ of all neighbors of $u$ in $G_f$ which have height greater than or equal to $u$. We'll update these attributes in the $\\text{PUSH}$ and $\\text{RELABEL}$ functions. It is clear from the pseudocode given for $\\text{PUSH}$ that we can execute it in constant time, provided we have maintain the attributes $\\delta_f(u, v)$, $u.e$, $c_f(u, v)$, $(u, v).f$ and $u.h$. Each time we call $\\text{PUSH}(u, v)$ the result is that $u$ is no longer overflowing, so we must remove it from the list.\n\n\nMaintain a pointer $u.overflow$ to $u$'s position in the overflow list. If a vertex $u$ is not overflowing, set $u.overflow = \\text{NIL}$. Next, check if $v$ became overflowing. If so, set $v.overflow$ equal to the head of the overflow list. Since we can update the pointer in constant time and delete from a linked list given a pointer to the element to be deleted in constant time, we can maintain the list in $O(1)$.\n\n\nThe $\\text{RELABEL}$ operation takes $O(V)$ because we need to compute the minimum $v.h$ from among all $(u, v) \\in E_f$, and there could be $|V| - 1$ many such $v$. We will also need to update $u.high$ during $\\text{RELABEL}$. When $\\text{RELABEL}(u)$ is called, set $u.high$ equal to the empty list and for each vertex $v$ which is adjacent to $u$, if $v.h = u.h + 1$, add $u$ to the list $v.high$.

Since the number of relabel operations is at most $2|V| - 1$ per vertex, edge $(u, v)$ will be examined during relabel operations at most $4|V| - 2 = O(V)$ times (at most $2|V| - 1$ times during calls to $\\text{RELABEL}(u)$ and at most $2|V| - 1$ times during calls to $\\text{RELABEL}(v)$). Summing up over all the possible residual edges, of which there are at most $2|E| = O(E)$, we see that the total time spent relabeling vertices is $O(VE)$.\n\n\n26.4-4\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that we have found a maximum flow in a flow network $G = (V, E)$ using a push-relabel algorithm. Give a fast algorithm to find a minimum cut in $G$.\n\n\n\n\nWe can find a minimum cut, given a maximum flow found in $G = (V, E)$ by a push-relabel algorithm, in $O(V)$ time. First, find a height $\\hat h$ such that $0 < \\hat h < |V|$ and there is no vertex whose height equals $\\hat h$ at termination of the algorithm. We need consider only $|V| - 2$ vertices, since $s.h = |V|$ and $t.h = 0$. Because $\\hat h$ can be one of at most $|V| - 1$ possible values, we know that for at least one number in $1, 2, \\ldots, |V| - 1$, there will be no vertex of that height. Hence, $\\hat h$ is well defined, and it is easy to find in $O(V)$ time by using a simple boolean array indexed by heights $1, 2, \\ldots, |V| - 1$.\n\n\nLet $S = {u \\in V: u.h > \\hat h}$ and $T = {v \\in V: v.h < \\hat h}$. Because we know that $s.h = |V| > \\hat h$, we have $s \\in S$, and because $t.h = 0 < \\hat h$, y we have $t \\in T$, as required for a cut.\n\n\nWe need to show that $f(u, v) = c(u, v)$, i.e., that $(u, v) \\notin E_f$, for all $u \\in S$ and $v \\in T$. Once we do that, we have that $f(S, T) = c(S, T)$, and by Corollary 26.5, $(S, T)$ is a minimum cut.\n\n\nSuppose for the purpose of contradiction that there exist vertices $u \\in S$ and $v \\in T$ such that $(u, v) \\in E_f$. Because $h$ is always maintained as a height function (Lemma 26.16), we have that $u.h \\le v.h + 1$. But we also have $v.h < \\hat h < u.h$, and because all values are integer, $v.h \\le u.h - 2$. Thus, we have $u.h \\le v.h + 1 \\le u.h - 2 + 1 = u.h - 1$, which gives the contradiction that $u.height \\le u.height - 1$. Thus, $(S, T)$ is a minimum cut.\n\n\n26.4-5\n\n\n\n\nGive an efficient push-relabel algorithm to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. Analyze your algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, construct the flow network for the bipartite graph as in the previous section. Then, we relabel everything in $L$. Then, we push from every vertex in $L$ to a vertex in $R$, so long as it is possible.\n\n\nKeeping track of those that vertices of $L$ that are still overflowing can be done by a simple bit vector. Then, we relabel everything in R and push to the last vertex. Once these operations have been done, The only possible valid operations are to relabel the vertices of $L$ that weren't able to find an edge that they could push their flow along, so could possibly have to get a push back from $R$ to $L$. This continues until there are no more operations to do. This takes time of $O(V(E + V))$.\n\n\n26.4-6\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that all edge capacities in a flow network $G = (V, E)$ are in the set ${1, 2, \\ldots, k}$. Analyze the running time of the generic push-relabel algorithm in terms of $|V|$, $|E|$, and $k$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ How many times can each edge support a nonsaturating push before it becomes saturated?)\n\n\n\n\nThe number of relabel operations and saturating pushes is the same as before. An edge can handle at most $k$ nonsaturating pushes before it becomes saturated, so the number of nonsaturating pushes is at most $2k|V||E|$. Thus, the total number of basic operations is at most $2|V|^2 + 2|V||E| + 2k|V||E| = O(kVE)$.\n\n\n26.4-7\n\n\n\n\nShow that we could change line 6 of $\\text{INITIALIZE-PREFLOW}$ to \n\n\n1\n \n6\n \ns\n.\nh\n \n=\n \n|\nG\n.\nV\n|\n \n-\n \n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwithout affecting the correctness or asymptotic performance of the generic pushrelabel algorithm.\n\n\n\n\nIf we set $s.h = |V| - 2$, we have to change our definition of a height function to allow $s.h = |V| - 2$, rather than $s.h = |V|$. The only change we need to make to the proof of correctness is to update the proof of Lemma 26.17. The original proof derives the contradiction that $s.h \\le k < |V|$, which is at odds with $s.h = |V|$. When $s.h = |V| - 2$, there is no contradiction.\n\n\nAs in the original proof, let us suppose that we have a simple augmenting path $\\langle v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k \\rangle$, where $v_0 = s$ and $v_k = t$, so that $k < |V|$. How could $(s, v_1)$ be a residual edge? It had been saturated in $\\text{INITIALIZE-PREFLOW}$, which means that we had to have pushed some flow from $v_1$ to $s$. In order for that to have happened, we must have had $v_1.h = s.h + 1$. If we set $s.h = |V| - 2$, then $v_1.h$ was $|V| - 1$ at the time. Since then, $v_1.h$ did not decrease, and so we have $v_1.h \\ge |V| - 1$. Working backwards over our augmenting path, we have $v_{k - i}.h \\le t.h + i$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, k$. As before, because the augmenting path is simple, $k < |V|$. Letting $i = k - 1$, we have $v_1.h \\le t.h + k - 1 < 0 + |V| - 1$. We now have the contradiction that $v_1.h \\ge |V| - 1$ and $v_1.h < |V| - 1$, which shows that Lemma 26.17 still holds.\n\n\nNothing in the analysis changes asymptotically.\n\n\n26.4-8\n\n\n\n\nLet $\\delta_f(u, v)$ be the distance (number of edges) from $u$ to $v$ in the residual network $G_f$. Show that the $\\text{GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL}$ procedure maintains the properties that $u.h < |V|$ implies $u.h \\le \\delta_f(u, t)$ and that $u.h \\ge |V|$ implies $u.h - |V| \\le \\delta_f(u, s)$.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll prove the claim by induction on the number of push and relabel operations. Initially, we have $u.h = |V|$ if $u = s$ and $0$ otherwise. We have $s.h - |V| = 0 \\le \\delta_f(s, s) = 0$ and $u.h = 0 \\le \\delta_f(u, t)$ for all $u \\ne s$, so the claim holds prior to the first iteration of the while loop on line 2 of the $\\text{GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL}$ algorithm. \n\n\nSuppose that the properties have been maintained thus far. If the next iteration is a nonsaturating push then the properties are maintained because the heights and existence of edges in the residual network are preserved. If it is a saturating push then edge $(u, v)$ is removed from the residual network, which increases both $\\delta_f(u, t)$ and $\\delta_f(u, s)$, so the properties are maintained regardless of the height of $u$. \n\n\nNow suppose that the next iteration causes a relabel of vertex $u$. For all $v$ such that $(u, v) \\in E_f$ we must have $u.h \\le v.h$. Let $v' = \\min{v.h \\mid (u,v) \\in E_f}$. There are two cases to consider. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, suppose that $v.h < |V|$. Then after relabeling we have \n\n\n$$u.h = 1 + v'.h \\le 1 + \\min_{(u, v)} \\in E_f \\delta_f(v, t) = \\delta_f(u, t).$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, suppose that $v'.h \\ge |V|$. Then after relabeling we have\n\n\n$$u.h = 1 + v'.h \\le 1 + |V| + \\min_{(u, v)} \\in E_f \\delta_f(v, s) = \\delta_f(u, s) + |V|,$$\n\n\nwhich implies that $u.h - |V| \\le \\delta_f(u, s)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the $\\text{GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL}$ procedure maintains the desired properties.\n\n\n26.4-9 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nAs in the previous exercise, let $\\delta_f(u, v)$ be the distance from $u$ to $v$ in the residual network $G_f$. Show how to modify the generic push-relabel algorithm to maintain the property that $u.h < |V|$ implies $u.h = \\delta_f(u, t)$ and that $u.h \\ge |V|$ implies $u.h - |V| = \\delta_f(u, s)$. The total time that your implementation dedicates to maintaining this property should be $O(VE)$.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we should do is to, for successive backwards neighborhoods of $t$, relabel everything in that neighborhood. This will only take at most $O(VE)$ time (see 26.4-3). This also has the upshot of making it so that once we are done with it, every vertex's height is equal to the quantity $\\delta_f(u, t)$. Then, since we begin with equality, after doing this, the inductive step we had in the solution to the previous exercise shows that this equality is preserved.\n\n\n26.4-10\n\n\n\n\nShow that the number of nonsaturating pushes executed by the $\\text{GENERIC-PUSH-RELABEL}$ procedure on a flow network $G = (V, E)$ is at most $4|V|^2|E|$ for $|V| \\ge 4$.\n\n\n\n\nEach vertex has maximum height $2|V| - 1$. Since heights don't decrease, and there are $|V| - 2$ vertices which can be overflowing, the maximum contribution of relabels to $\\Phi$ over all vertices is $(2|V| - 1)(|V| - 2)$. A saturating push from $u$ to $v$ increases $\\Phi$ by at most $v.h \\le 2|V| - 1$, and there are at most $2|V||E|$ saturating pushes, so the total contribution over all saturating pushes to $\\Phi$ is at most $(2|V| - 1)(2|V||E|)$. Since each nonsaturating push decrements $\\Phi$ by at least on and $\\Phi$ must equal zero upon termination, we must have that the number of nonsaturating pushes is at most\n\n\n$$(2|V| - 1)(|V| - 2) + (2|V| - 1)(2|V||E|) = 4|V|^2|E| + 2|V|^2 - 5|V| + 3 - 2|V||E|.$$\n\n\nUsing the fact that $|E| \\ge |V| - 1$ and $|V| \\ge 4$ we can bound the number of\nsaturating pushes by $4|V|^2|E|$.",

We must select an appropriate data structure to store all the information which will allow us to select a valid operation in constant time. To do this, we will need to maintain a list of overflowing vertices. By Lemma 26.14, a push or a relabel operation always applies to an overflowing vertex. To determine which operation to perform, we need to determine whether $u.h = v.h + 1$ for some $v \\in N(u)$. We'll do this by maintaining a list $u.high$ of all neighbors of $u$ in $G_f$ which have height greater than or equal to $u$. We'll update these attributes in the $\\text{PUSH}$ and $\\text{RELABEL}$ functions. It is clear from the pseudocode given for $\\text{PUSH}$ that we can execute it in constant time, provided we have maintain the attributes $\\delta_f(u, v)$, $u.e$, $c_f(u, v)$, $(u, v).f$ and $u.h$. Each time we call $\\text{PUSH}(u, v)$ the result is that $u$ is no longer overflowing, so we must remove it from the list.  Maintain a pointer $u.overflow$ to $u$'s position in the overflow list. If a vertex $u$ is not overflowing, set $u.overflow = \\text{NIL}$. Next, check if $v$ became overflowing. If so, set $v.overflow$ equal to the head of the overflow list. Since we can update the pointer in constant time and delete from a linked list given a pointer to the element to be deleted in constant time, we can maintain the list in $O(1)$.  The $\\text{RELABEL}$ operation takes $O(V)$ because we need to compute the minimum $v.h$ from among all $(u, v) \\in E_f$, and there could be $|V| - 1$ many such $v$. We will also need to update $u.high$ during $\\text{RELABEL}$. When $\\text{RELABEL}(u)$ is called, set $u.high$ equal to the empty list and for each vertex $v$ which is adjacent to $u$, if $v.h = u.h + 1$, add $u$ to the list $v.high$.

A saturating push from $u$ to $v$ increases $\\Phi$ by at most $v.h \\le 2|V| - 1$, and there are at most $2|V||E|$ saturating pushes, so the total contribution over all saturating pushes to $\\Phi$ is at most $(2|V| - 1)(2|V||E|)$. Since each nonsaturating push decrements $\\Phi$ by at least on and $\\Phi$ must equal zero upon termination, we must have that the number of nonsaturating pushes is at most  $$(2|V| - 1)(|V| - 2) + (2|V| - 1)(2|V||E|) = 4|V|^2|E| + 2|V|^2 - 5|V| + 3 - 2|V||E|.$$  Using the fact that $|E| \\ge |V| - 1$ and $|V| \\ge 4$ we can bound the number of\nsaturating pushes by $4|V|^2|E|$.",

Then, we consider $v_1$ since it is the first element in the $L$ list. When we discharge it, we increase it's height to $1$ so that it can dump $12$ of it's excess along its edge to vertex $v_3$, to discharge the rest of it, it has to increase it's height to $|V| + 1$ to discharge it back to $s$. It was already at the front, so, we consider $v_2$. We increase its height to $1$. Then, we send all of its excess along its edge to $v_4$. We move it to the front, which means we next consider $v_1$, and do nothing because it is not overflowing. Up next is vertex $v_3$. After increasing its height to $1$, it can send all of its excess to $t$. This puts $v_3$ at the front, and we consider the non-overflowing vertices $v_2$ and $v_1$. Then, we consider $v_4$, it increases its height to $1$, then sends $4$ units to $t$. Since it still has an excess of $10$ units, it increases its height once again. Then it becomes valid for it to send flow back to $v_2$ or to $v_3$. It considers $v_4$ first because of the ordering of its neighbor list. This means that $10$ units of flow are pushed back to $v_2$. Since $v_4.h$ increased, it moves to the front of the list Then, we consider $v_2$ since it is the only still overflowing vertex. We increase its height to $3$. Then, it is overflowing by $10$ so it increases its height to $3$ to send $6$ units to $v_4$. It's height increased so it goes to the  of the list. Then, we consider $v_4$, which is overflowing. it increases its height to $3$, then it sends $6$ units to $v_3$. Again, it goes to the front of the list. Up next is $v_2$ which is not overflowing, $v_3$ which is, so it increases it's height by $1$ to send $4$ units of flow to $t$. Then sends $2$ units to $v_4$ after increasing in height. The excess flow keeps bobbing around the four vertices, each time requiring them to increase their height a bit to discharge to a neighbor only to have that neighbor increase to discharge it back until $v_2$ has increased in height enough to send all of it's excess back to s, this completes and gives us a maximum flow of $23$.\n\n\n26.5-2 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to implement a push-relabel algorithm in which we maintain a firstin, first-out queue of overflowing vertices. The algorithm repeatedly discharges the vertex at the head of the queue, and any vertices that were not overflowing before the discharge but are overflowing afterward are placed at the end of the queue. After the vertex at the head of the queue is discharged, it is removed. When the queue is empty, the algorithm terminates. Show how to implement this algorithm to compute a maximum flow in $O(V^3)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nInitially, the vertices adjacent to $s$ are the only ones which are overflowing. The implementation is as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nPUSH\n-\nRELABEL\n-\nQUEUE\n(\nG\n,\n \ns\n)\n\n    \nINITIALIZE\n-\nPREFLOW\n(\nG\n,\n \ns\n)\n\n    \nInitialize\n \nan\n \nempty\n \nqueue\n \nq\n\n    \nfor\n \nv\n \n\u2208\n \nG\n.\nAdj\n[\ns\n]\n\n        \nq\n.\npush\n(\nv\n)\n\n    \nwhile\n \nq\n.\nhead\n \n!=\n \nNIL\n\n        \nDISCHARGE\n(\nq\n.\nhead\n)\n\n        \nq\n.\npop\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we need to modify the $\\text{DISCHARGE}$ algorithm to push vertices $v$ onto the queue if $v$ was not overflowing before a discharge but is overflowing after one.\n\n\nBetween lines 7 and 8 of $\\text{DISCHARGE}(u)$, add the line ''if $v.e > 0$, $q.push(v)$.'' This is an implementation of the generic push-relabel algorithm, so we know it is correct. The analysis of runtime is almost identical to that of Theorem 26.30. We just need to verify that there are at most $|V|$ calls to $\\text{DISCHARGE}$ between two consecutive relabel operations. Observe that after calling $\\text{PUSH}(u, v)$, Corollary 26.28 tells us that no admissible edges are entering $v$. Thus, once $v$ is put into the queue because of the push, it can't be added again until it has been relabeled. Thus, at most $|V|$ vertices are added to the queue between relabel operations.\n\n\n26.5-3\n\n\n\n\nShow that the generic algorithm still works if $\\text{RELABEL}$ updates $u.h$ by simply computing $u.h = u.h + 1$. How would this change affect the analysis of $\\text{RELABEL-TO-FRONT}$?\n\n\n\n\nIf we change relabel to just increment the value of $u$, we will not be ruining the correctness of the Algorithm. This is because since it only applies when $u.h \\le v.h$, we won't be every creating a graph where $h$ ceases to be a height function, since $u.h$ will only ever be increasing by exactly $1$ whenever relabel is called, ensuring that $u.h + 1 \\le v.h$. This means that Lemmatae 26.15 and 26.16 will still hold. Even Corollary 26.21 holds since all it counts on is that relabel causes some vertex's $h$ value to increase by at least $1$, it will still work when we have all of the operations causing it to increase by exactly $1$. However, Lemma 26.28 will no longer hold. That is, it may require more than a single relabel operation to cause an admissible edge to appear, if for example, $u.h$ was strictly less than the $h$ values of all its neighbors. However, this lemma is not used in the proof of Exercise 26.4-3, which bounds the number of relabel operations. Since the number of relabel operations still have the same bound, and we know that we can simulate the old relabel operation by doing (possibly many) of these new relabel operations, we have the same bound as in the original algorithm with this different relabel operation.\n\n\n26.5-4 $\\star$\n\n\n\n\nShow that if we always discharge a highest overflowing vertex, we can make the push-relabel method run in $O(V^3)$ time.\n\n\n\n\nWe'll keep track of the heights of the overflowing vertices using an array and a series of doubly linked lists. In particular, let $A$ be an array of size $|V|$, and let $A[i]$ store a list of the elements of height $i$. Now we create another list $L$, which is a list of lists. The head points to the list containing the vertices of highest height. The next pointer of this list points to the next nonempty list stored in $A$, and so on. This allows for constant time insertion of a vertex into $A$, and also constant time access to an element of largest height, and because all lists are doubly linked, we can add and delete elements in constant time. Essentially, we are implementing the algorithm of Exercise 26.5-2, but with the queue replaced by a priority queue with constant time operations. As before, it will suffice to show that there are at most $|V|$ calls to discharge between consecutive relabel operations.\n\n\nConsider what happens when a vertex $v$ is put into the priority queue. There must exist a vertex $u$ for which we have called $\\text{PUSH}(u, v)$. After this, no ad- missible edge is entering $v$, so it can't be added to the priority queue again until after a relabel operation has occurred on $v$. Moreover, every call to $\\text{DISCHARGE}$ terminates with a $\\text{PUSH}$, so for every call to $\\text{DISCHARGE}$ there is another vertex which can't be added until a relabel operation occurs. After $|V|$ $\\text{DISCHARGE}$ operations and no relabel operations, there are no remaining valid $\\text{PUSH}$ operations, so either the algorithm terminates, or there is a valid relabel operation which is performed. Thus, there are $O(V^3)$ calls to $\\text{DISCHARGE}$. By carrying out the rest of the analysis of Theorem 26.30, we conclude that the runtime is $O(V^3)$.\n\n\n26.5-5\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that at some point in the execution of a push-relabel algorithm, there exists an integer $0 < k \\le |V| - 1$ for which no vertex has $v.h = k$. Show that all vertices with $v.h > k$ are on the source side of a minimum cut. If such a $k$ exists, the \ngap heuristic\n updates every vertex $v \\in V - \\{s\\}$ for which $v.h > k$, to set $v.h = \\max(v.h, |V| + 1)$. Show that the resulting attribute $h$ is a height function. (The gap heuristic is crucial in making implementations of the push-relabel method perform well in practice.)\n\n\n\n\nSuppose to try and obtain a contradiction that there were some minimum cut for which a vertex that had $v.h > k$ were on the sink side of that cut. For that minimum cut, there is a residual flow network for which that cut is saturated. Then, if there were any vertices that were also on the sink side of the cut which had an edge going to $v$ in this residual flow network, since it's $h$ value cannot be equal to $k$, we know that it must be greater than $k$ since it could be only at most one less than $v$. We can continue in this way to let $S$ be the set of vertices on the sink side of the graph which have an $h$ value greater than $k$. Suppose that there were some simple path from a vertex in $S$ to $s$. Then, at each of these steps, the height could only decrease by at most $1$, since it cannot get from above $k$ to $0$ without going through $k$, we know that there is no path in the residual flow network going from a vertex in $S$ to $s$. Since a minimal cut corresponds to disconnected parts of the residual graph for a maximum flow, and we know there is no path from $S$ to $s$, there is a minimum cut for which $S$ lies entirely on the source side of the cut. This was a contradiction to how we selected $v$, and so have shown the first claim.\n\n\nNow we show that after updating the $h$ values as suggested, we are still left with a height function. Suppose we had an edge $(u, v)$ in the residual graph. We knew from before that $u.h \\le v.h + 1$. However, this means that if $u.h > k$, so must be $v.h$. So, if both were above $k$, we would be making them equal, causing the inequality to still hold. Also, if just $v.k$ were above $k$, then we have not decreased it's $h$ value, meaning that the inequality also still must hold. Since we have not changed the value of $s.h$, and $t.h$, we have all the required properties to have a height function after modifying the $h$ values as described.",

We must show how to formulate the max-flow problem and how to construct the path cover from the resulting matching, and we must prove that the algorithm indeed finds a minimum path cover.\n\n\nDefine $G'$ as suggested, with directed edges. Make $G'$ into a flow network with source $x_0$ and sink $y_0$ by defining all edge capacities to be $1$. $G'$ is the flow network corresponding to a bipartite graph $G''$ in which $L = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, $R = \\{y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\}$, and the edges are the (undirected version of the) subset of $E'$ that doesn't involve $x_0$ or $y_0$ .\n\n\nThe relationship of $G$ to the bipartite graph $G''$ is that every vertex $i$ in $G$ is represented by two vertices, $x_i$ and $y_i$, in $G''$. Edge $(i, j)$ in $G$ corresponds to edge $(x_i, y_j)$ in $G''$. That is, an edge $(x_i, y_j)$ in $G''$ means that an edge in $G$ leaves $i$ and enters $j$. Vertex $x_i$ tells us about edges leaving $i$, and $y_i$ tells us about edges entering $i$.\n\n\nThe edges in a bipartite matching in $G''$ can be used in a path cover of $G$, for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\nIn a bipartite matching, no vertex is used more than once. In a bipartite matching in $G''$, since no $x_i$ is used more than once, at most one edge in the matching leaves any vertex $i$ in $G$. Similarly, since no $y_j$ is used more than once, at most one edge in the matching enters any vertex $j$ in $G$.\n\n\nIn a path cover, since no vertex appears in more than one path, at most one path edge enters each vertex and at most one path edge leaves each vertex.\n\n\n\n\nWe can construct a path cover $P$ from any bipartite matching $M$ (not just a maximum matching) by moving from some $x_i$ to its matching $y_j$ (if any), then from $x_j$ to its matching $y_k$, and so on, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nStart a new path containing a vertex $i$ that has not yet been placed in a path.\n\n\nIf $x_i$ is unmatched, the path can't go any farther; just add it to $P$.\n\n\nIf $x_i$ is matched to some $y_j$, add $j$ to the current path. If $j$ has already been placed in a path (i.e., though we've just entered $j$ by processing $y_j$, we've already built a path that leaves $j$ by processing $x_j$), combine this path with that one and go back to step 1. Otherwise go to step 2 to process $x_j$.\n\n\n\n\nThis algorithm constructs a path cover, for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n\nEvery vertex is put into some path, because we keep picking an unused vertex from which to start a path until there are no unused vertices.\n\n\nNo vertex is put into two paths, because every $x_i$ is matched to at most one $y_j$, and vice versa. That is, at most one candidate edge leaves each vertex, and at most one candidate edge enters each vertex. When building a path, we start or enter a vertex and then leave it, building a single path. If we ever enter a vertex that was left earlier, it must have been the start of another path, since there are no cycles, and we combine those paths so that the vertex is entered and left on a single path.\n\n\n\n\nEvery edge in $M$ is used in some path because we visit every $x_i$, and we incorporate the single edge, if any, from each visited $x_i$. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between edges in the matching and edges in the constructed path cover.\n\n\nWe now show that the path cover $P$ constructed above has the fewest possible paths when the matching is maximum.\n\n\nLet $f$ be the flow corresonding to the bipartite matching $M$.\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|V| & = \\sum_{p \\in P} \\text{(# vertices in $p$)} & \\text{(every vertex is on exactly 1 path)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{p \\in P} \\text{(1 + # edges in $p$)} \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{p \\in P} 1 + \\sum_{p \\in P} \\text{(# edges in $p$)} \\\\\n    & = |P| + |M|                                 & \\text{(by 1-to-1 correspondence)} \\\\\n    & = |P| + |f|.                                & \\text{(by Lemma 26.9)}\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, for the fixed set $V$ in our graph $G$, $|P|$ (the number of paths) is minimized when the flow $f$ is maximized.\n\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nUse $\\text{FORD-FULKERSON}$ to find a maximum flow in $G'$ and hence a maximum bipartite matching $M$ in $G''$.\n\n\nConstruct the path cover as described above.\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n\n$O(VE)$ total:\n\n\n\n\n$O(V + E)$ to set up $G'$, \n\n\n$O(VE)$ to find the maximum bipartite matching,\n\n\n$O(E)$ to trace the paths, because each edge $\\in M$ is traversed only once and there are $O(E)$ edges in $M$.\n\n\n\n\nb.\n The algorithm does not work if there are cycles.\n\n\nConsider a graph $G$ with $4$ vertices, consisting of a directed triangle and an edge pointing to the triangle:\n\n\n$$E = \\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1)\\}.$$\n\n\n$G$ can be covered with a single path: $4 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$, but our algorithm might find only a $2$-path cover.\n\n\nIn the bipartite graph $G'$, the edges $(x_i, y_j)$ are\n\n\n$$(x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_3), (x_3, y_1), (x_4, y_1).$$\n\n\nThere are $4$ edges from an $x_i$ to a $y_j$, but $2$ of them lead to $y_1$, so a maximum bipartite matching can have only $3$ edges (and the maximum flow in $G'$ has value $3$). In fact, there are $2$ possible maximum matchings. It is always possible to match $(x_1, y_2)$ and $(x_2, y_3)$, and then either $(x_3, y_1)$ or $(x_4, y_1)$ can be chosen, but not both.\n\n\nThe maximum flow found by one of our max-flow algorithms could find the flow corresponding to either of these matchings, since both are maximal. If it finds the matching with edge $(x_3, x_1)$, then the matching would not contain $(x_4, x_1)$; given that matching, our path algorithm is forced to produce $2$ paths, one of which contains just the vertex $4$.",

He has identified n important subareas of algorithms (roughly corresponding to different portions of this textbook), which he represents by the set $A = \\{A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n\\}$. In each subarea $A_k$, he can hire an expert in that area for $c_k$ dollars. The consulting company has lined up a set $J = \\{J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_m\\}$ of potential jobs. In order to perform job $J_i$, the company needs to have hired experts in a subset $R_i \\subseteq A$ of subareas. Each expert can work on multiple jobs simultaneously. If the company chooses to accept job $J_i$, it must have hired experts in all subareas in $R_i$, and it will take in revenue of $p_i$ dollars.\n\n\nProfessor Gore's job is to determine which subareas to hire experts in and which jobs to accept in order to maximize the net revenue, which is the total income from jobs accepted minus the total cost of employing the experts.\n\n\nConsider the following flow network $G$. It contains a source vertex $s$, vertices $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n$, vertices $J_1, J_2, \\ldots, J_m$, and a sink vertex $t$. For $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, the flow network contains an edge $(s, A_k)$ with capacity $c(s, A_k) = c_k$, and for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$, the flow network contains an edge $(J_i, t)$ with capacity $c(J_i, t) = p_i$. For $k = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$ and $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$, if $A_k \\in R_i$, then $G$ contains an edge $(A_k, J_i)$ with capacity $c(A_k, J_i) = \\infty$.\n\n\na.\n Show that if $J_i \\in T$ for a finite-capacity cut $(S, T)$ of $G$, then $A_k \\in T$ for each $A_k \\in R_i$.\n\n\nb.\n Show how to determine the maximum net revenue from the capacity of a minimum cut of $G$ and the given $p_i$ values.\n\n\nc.\n Give an efficient algorithm to determine which jobs to accept and which experts to hire.

Since $A_k \\notin T$, we must have $A_k \\in S$. On the other hand, we have $J_i \\in T$. Thus, the edge $(A_k, J_i)$ crosses the cut $(S, T)$. But $c(A_k, J_i) = \\infty$ by construction, which contradicts the assumption that $(S, T)$ is a finite-capacity cut.\n\n\nb.\n Let us define a \nproject-plan\n as a set of jobs to accept and experts to hire. Let $P$ be a project-plan. We assume that $P$ has two attributes. The attribute $P.J$ denotes the set of accepted jobs, and $P.A$ denotes the set of hired experts.\n\n\nA \nvalid\n project-plan is one in which we have hired all experts that are required by the accepted jobs. Specifically, let $P$ be a valid project plan. If $J_i \\in P.J$, then $A_k \\in P.A$ for each $A_k \\in R_i$. Note that Professor Gore might decide to hire more experts than those that are actually required.\n\n\nWe define the \nrevenue\n of a project-plan as the total profit from the accepted jobs minus the total cost of the hired experts. The problem asks us to find a valid project plan with maximum revenue.\n\n\nWe start by proving the following lemma, which establishes the relationship between the capacity of a cut in flow network $G$ and the revenue of a valid project-plan.\n\n\nLemma (Min-cut max-revenue)\n \n\n\nThere exists a finite-capacity cut $(S, T)$ of $G$ with capacity $c(S, T)$ if and only if there exists a valid project-plan with net revenue $(\\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i) - c(S, T)$.\n\n\nProof\n \n\n\nLet $(S, T)$ be a finite-capacity cut of $G$ with capacity $c(S, T)$. We prove one direction of the lemma by constructing the required project-plan.\n\n\nConstruct the project-plan $P$ by including $J_i$ in $P.J$ if and only if $J_i \\in T$ and including $A_k$ in $P.A$ if and only if $A_k \\in T$. From part (a), $P$ is a valid project-plan, since, for every $J_i \\in P.J$, we have $A_k \\in P.A$ for each $A_k \\in R_i$.\n\n\nSince the capacity of the cut is finite, there cannot be any edges of the form $(A_k, J_i)$ crossing the cut, where $A_k \\in S$ and $J_i \\in T$. All edges going from a vertex in $S$ to a vertex in $T$ must be either of the form $(s, A_k)$ or of the form $(J_i, t)$. Let $E_A$ be the set of edges of the form $(s, A_k)$ that cross the cut, and let $E_J$ be the set of edges of the form $(J_i, t)$ that cross the cut, so that\n\n\n$$c(S, T) = \\sum_{(s, A_k) \\in E_A} c(s, A_k) + \\sum_{(J_i, j) \\in E_J} c(J_i, t).$$\n\n\nConsider edges of the form $(s, A_k)$. We have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n(s, A_k) \\in E_A\n    & \\text{ if and only if $A_k \\in T$} \\\\\n    & \\text{ if and only if $A_k \\in P.A$}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nBy construction, $c(s, A_k) = c_k$. Taking summations over $E_A$ and over $P.A$, we obtain\n\n\n$$\\sum_{(s, A_k) \\in E_A} c(s, A_k) = \\sum_{A_k \\in P.A} c_k.$$\n\n\nSimilarly, consider edges of the form $(J_i, t)$. We have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n(J_i, t) \\in E_J\n    & \\text{ if and only if $J_i \\in S$} \\\\\n    & \\text{ if and only if $J_i \\notin T$} \\\\\n    & \\text{ if and only if $J_i \\notin P.J$}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\nBy construction, $c(J_i, t) = p_i$. Taking summations over $E_J$ and over $P.J$, we obtain\n\n\n$$\\sum_{(J_i, t) \\in E_J} c(J_i, t) = \\sum_{J_i \\notin P.J} p_i.$$\n\n\nLet $v$ be the net revenue of $P$. Then, we have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nv & = \\sum_{J_i \\in P.J} p_i - \\sum_{A_k \\in P.A} c_k \\\\\n  & = \\Bigg( \\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i - \\sum_{J_i \\notin P.J} p_i \\Bigg) - \\sum_{A_k \\in P.A} c_k \\\\\n  & = \\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i - \\Bigg( \\sum_{J_i \\notin P.J} p_i + \\sum_{A_k \\in P.A} c_k \\Bigg) \\\\\n  & = \\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i - \\Bigg( \\sum_{(J_i, t) \\in E_J} c(J_i, t) + \\sum_{(s, A_k) \\in E_A} c(s, A_k) \\Bigg) \\\\\n  & = \\Bigg( \\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i \\Bigg) - c(S, T).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nNow, we prove the other direction of the lemma by constructing the required cut from a valid project-plan.\n\n\nConstruct the cut $(S, T)$ as follows. For every $J_i \\in P.J$, let $J_i \\in T$. For every $A_k \\in P.A$, let $A_k \\in T$.\n\n\nFirst, we prove that the cut $(S, T)$ is a finite-capacity cut. Since edges of the form $(A_k, J_i)$ are the only infinite-capacity edges, it suffices to prove that there are no edges $(A_k, J_i)$ such that $A_k \\in S$ and $J_i \\in T$.\n\n\nFor the purpose of contradiction, assume there is an edge $(A_k, J_i)$ such that $A_k \\in S$ and $J_i \\in T$. By our constuction, we must have $J_i \\in P.J$ and $A_k \\notin P.A$. But since the edge $(A_k, J_i)$ exists, we have $A_k \\in R_i$. Since $P$ is a valid project-plan, we derive the contradiction that $A_k$ must have been in $P.A$.\n\n\nFrom here on, the analysis is the same as the previous direction. In particular, the last equation from the previous analysis holds: the net revenue $v$ equals $(\\sum_{J_i \\in J} p_i) - c(S, T)$.\n\n\nWe conclude that the problem of finding a maximum-revenue project-plan reduces to the problem of finding a minimum cut in $G$. Let $(S, T)$ be a minimum cut. From the lemma, the maximum net revenue is given by\n\n\n$$\\Bigg( \\sum_{j_i \\in J} p_i \\Bigg) - c(S, T).$$\n\n\nc.\n Construct the flow network $G$ as shown in the problem statement. Obtain a minimum cut $(S, T)$ by running any of the maximum-flow algorithms (say, Edmonds-Karp). Construct the project plan $P$ as follows: add $J_i$ to $P.J$ if and only if $J_i \\in T$. Add $A_k$ to $P.A$ if and only if $A_k \\in T$.\n\n\nFirst, we note that the number of vertices in $G$ is $|V| = m + n + 2$, and the number of edges in $G$ is $|E| = r + m + n$. Constructing $G$ and recovering the project-plan from the minimum cut are clearly linear-time operations. The running time of our algorithm is thus asymptotically the same as the running time of the algorithm used to find the minimum cut. If we use Edmonds-Karp to find the minimum cut, the running time is $O(VE^2)$.",

We will show that $|f| + |f'| = c(S, T)$ which, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, will prove that $f \\uparrow f'$ is a maximum flow in $G$.\n\n\nWe have\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|f| + |f'|\n    & = f(S, T) + c_f(S, T) \\\\\n    & = \\Bigg( \\sum_{u \\in S} \\sum_{v \\in T} f(u, v) - \\sum_{u \\in S} \\sum_{v \\in T} f(v, u) \\Bigg) + \\sum_{u \\in S} \\sum_{v \\in T} c_f(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\Bigg( \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T} f(u, v) - \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T} f(v, u) \\Bigg) + \\Bigg( \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (u, v) \\in E} c(u, v) - \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (u, v) \\in E} f(u, v) + \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (v, u) \\in E} f(v, u) \\Bigg). \n\\end{align}\n\n\nNoting that $(u, v) \\notin E$ implies $f(u, v) = 0$, we have that\n\n\n$$\\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T} f(u, v) = \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (u, v) \\in E} f(u, v).$$\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\n$$\\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T} f(v, u) = \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (v, u) \\in E} f(v, u).$$\n\n\nThus, the summations of $f(u, v)$ cancel each other out, as do the summations of $f(v, u)$. Therefore,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n|f| + |f'|\n    & = \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T, (u, v) \\in E} c(u, v) \\\\\n    & = \\sum_{u \\in S} \\sum_{v \\in T} c(u, v) \\\\\n    & = c(S, T).\n\\end{align}\n\n\nBy this lemma, we see that the value of a maximum flow in $G$ is at most $2K|E|$ more than the value of the current flow $f$ in $G$. Every time the inner \nwhile\n loop finds an augmenting path of capacity at least $K$, the flow in $G$ increases by at least $K$. Since the flow cannot increase by more than $2K|E|$, the loop executes at most $(2K|E|) / K = 2|E|$ times.\n\n\nf.\n The time complexity is dominated by the \nwhile\n loop of lines 4\u20137. (The lines outside the loop take $O(E)$ time.) The outer \nwhile\n loop executes $O(\\lg C)$ times, since $K$ is initially $O(C)$ and is halved on each iteration, until $K < 1$. By part (e), the inner \nwhile\n loop executes $O(E)$ times for each value of $K$, and by part (b), each iteration takes $O(E)$ time. Thus, the total time is $O(E^2 \\lg C)$.",

Given an undirected, bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V = L \\cup R$ and all edges have exactly one endpoint in $L$, let $M$ be a matching in $G$. We say that a simple path $P$ in $G$ is an \naugmenting path\n with respect to $M$ if it starts at an unmatched vertex in $L$, ends at an unmatched vertex in $R$, and its edges belong alternately to $M$ and $E - M$. (This definition of an augmenting path is related to, but different from, an augmenting path in a flow network.) In this problem, we treat a path as a sequence of edges, rather than as a sequence of vertices. A shortest augmenting path with respect to a matching $M$ is an augmenting path with a minimum number of edges.\n\n\nGiven two sets $A$ and $B$, the \nsymmetric difference\n $A \\oplus B$ is defined as $(A - B) \\cup (B - A)$, that is, the elements that are in exactly one of the two sets.\n\n\na.\n Show that if $M$ is a matching and $P$ is an augmenting path with respect to $M$, then the symmetric difference $M \\oplus P$ is a matching and $|M \\oplus P| = |M| + 1$.

Conclude that the total running time of $\\text{HOPCROFT-KARP}$ is $O(\\sqrt V E)$.\n\n\n\n\na.\n Suppose $M$ is a matching and $P$ is an augmenting path with respect to $M$. Then $P$ consists of $k$ edges in $M$, and $k + 1$ edges not in $M$. This is because the first edge of $P$ touches an unmatched vertex in $L$, so it cannot be in $M$. Similarly, the last edge in $P$ touches an unmatched vertex in $R$, so the last edge cannot be in $M$. Since the edges alternate being in or not in $M$, there must be exactly one more edge not in $M$ than in $M$. This implies that\n\n\n$$|M \\oplus P| = |M| + |P| - 2k = |M| + 2k + 1 - 2k = |M| + 1,$$\n\n\nsince we must remove each edge of $M$ which is in $P$ from both $M$ and $P$. Now suppose $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$ are vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. Let $k_i$ be the number of edges in $P_i$ which are in $M$, so that $|P_i| = 2k + i + 1$. Then we have\n\n\n$$M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup P_2 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k) = |M| + |P_1| + \\cdots + |P_k| - 2k_1 - 2k_2 - \\cdots - 2k_k = |M| + k.$$\n\n\nTo see that we in fact get a matching, suppose that there was some vertex $v$ which had at least $2$ incident edges $e$ and $e'$. They cannot both come from $M$, since $M$ is a matching. They cannot both come from $P$ since $P$ is simple and every other edge of $P$ is removed. Thus, $e \\in M$ and $e' \\in P \\backslash M$. However, if $e \\in M$ then $e \\in P$, so $e \\notin M \\oplus P$, a contradiction. A similar argument gives the case of $M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k)$.\n\n\nb.\n Suppose some vertex in $G'$ has degree at least $3$. Since the edges of $G'$ come from $M \\oplus M^*$, at least $2$ of these edges come from the same matching. However, a matching never contains two edges with the same endpoint, so this is impossible. Thus every vertex has degree at most $2$, so $G'$ is a disjoint union of simple paths and cycles. If edge $(u, v)$ is followed by edge $(z, w)$ in a simple path or cycle then we must have $v = z$. Since two edges with the same endpoint cannot appear in a matching, they must belong alternately to $M$ and $M^*$. Since edges alternate, every cycle has the same number of edges in each matching and every path has at most one more edge in one matching than in the other. Thus, if $|M| \\le |M^*|$ there must be at least $|M^*| - |M|$ vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$.\n\n\nc.\n Every vertex matched by $M$ must be incident with some edge in $M'$. Since $P$ is augmenting with respect to $M$\u2032, the left endpoint of the first edge of $P$ isn't incident to a vertex touched by an edge in $M'$. In particular, $P$ starts at a vertex in $L$ which is unmatched by $M$ since every vertex of $M$ is incident with an edge in $M'$. Since $P$ is vertex disjoint from $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_k$, any edge of $P$ which is in $M'$ must in fact be in $M$ and any edge of $P$ which is not in $M'$ cannot be in $M$. Since $P$ has edges alternately in $M'$ and $E - M'$, $P$ must in fact have edges alternately in $M$ and $E - M$. Finally, the last edge of $P$ must be incident to a vertex in $R$ which is unmatched by $M'$. Any vertex unmatched by $M'$ is also unmatched by $M$, so $P$ is an augmenting path for $M$. $P$ must have length at least $l$ since $l$ is the length of the shortest augmenting path with respect to $M$. If $P$ had length exactly $l$, then this would contradict the fact that $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$ is a maximal set of vertex disjoint paths of length $l$ because we could add $P$ to the set. Thus $P$ has more than $l$ edges.\n\n\nd.\n Any edge in $M \\oplus M'$ is in exactly one of $M$ or $M'$. Thus, the only possible contributing edges from $M'$ are from $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$. An edge from $M$ can contribute if and only if it is not in exactly one of $M$ and $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$, which means it must be in both. Thus, the edges from $M$ are redundant so $M \\oplus M' = (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k)$ which implies $A = (P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k) \\oplus P$.\n\n\nNow we'll show that $P$ is edge disjoint from each $P_i$. Suppose that an edge $e$ of $P$ is also an edge of $P_i$ for some $i$. Since $P$ is an augmenting path with respect to $M'$ either $e \\in M'$ or $e \\in E - M'$. Suppose $e \\in M'$. Since $P$ is also augmenting with respect to $M$, we must have $e \\in M$. However, if $e$ is in $M$ and $M'$, then $e$ cannot be in any of the $P_i$'s by the definition of $M'$. Now suppose $e \\in E - M'$. Then $e \\in E - M$ since $P$ is augmenting with respect to $M$. Since $e$ is an edge of $P_i$, $e \\in E - M'$ implies that $e \\in M$, a contradiction.\n\n\nSince $P$ has edges alternately in $M'$ and $E - M'$ and is edge disjoint from $P_1 \\cup \\cdots \\cup P_k$, $P$ is also an augmenting path for $M$, which implies $|P| \\ge l$. Since every edge in $A$ is disjoint we conclude that $|A| \\ge (k + 1)l$.\n\n\ne.\n Suppose $M^*$ is a matching with strictly more than $|M| + |V| / (l + 1)$ edges. By part (b) there are strictly more than $|V| / (l + 1)$ vertex-disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. Each one of these contains at least $l$ edges, so it is incident on $l + 1$ vertices. Since the paths are vertex disjoint, there are strictly more than $|V|(l + 1) / (l + 1)$ distinct vertices incident with these paths, a contradiction. Thus, the size of the maximum matching is at most $|M| + |V| / (l + 1)$.\n\n\nf.\n Consider what happens after iteration number $\\sqrt{|V|}$. Let $M^*$ be a maximal matching in $G$. Then $|M^*| \\ge |M|$ so by part (b), $M \\oplus M^*$ contains at least $|M^*| - |M|$ vertex disjoint augmenting paths with respect to $M$. By part (c), each of these is also a an augmenting path for $M$. Since each has length  $\\sqrt{|V|}$, there can be at most $\\sqrt{|V|}$ such paths, so $|M^*| - |M| \\le \\sqrt{|V|}$. Thus, only $\\sqrt{|V|}$ additional iterations of the repeat loop can occur, so there are at most $2\\sqrt{|V|}$ iterations in total.\n\n\ng.\n For each unmatched vertex in $L$ we can perform a modified $\\text{BFS}$ to find the length of the shortest path to an unmatched vertex in $R$. Modify the $\\text{BFS}$ to ensure that we only traverse an edge if it causes the path to alternate between an edge in $M$ and an edge in $E - M$. The first time an unmatched vertex in $R$ is reached we know the length $k$ of a shortest augmenting path.\n\n\nWe can use this to stop our search early if at any point we have traversed more than that number of edges. To find disjoint paths, start at the vertices of $R$ which were found at distance $k$ in the $\\text{BFS}$. Run a $\\text{DFS}$ backwards from these, which maintains the property that the next vertex we pick has distance one fewer, and the edges alternate between being in $M$ and $E - M$. As we build up a path, mark the vertices as used so that we never traverse them again. This takes $O(E)$, so by part (f) the total runtime is $O(\\sqrt VE)$.",

Assume that this is executed on $k$ processors. In one execution, each strand from among the $k$ on the left is executed concurrently, and then the $m$ strands on the right are executed one at a time. If each strand takes unit time to execute, then the total computation takes $2m$ time. On the other hand, suppose that on each time step of the computation, $k - 1$ strands from the left (descendants of $u$) are executed, and one from the right (a descendant of $v$), is executed. If each strand take unit time to executed, the total computation takes $m + m / k$. Thus, the ratio of times is $2m / (m + m / k) = 2 / (1 + 1 / k)$. As $k$ gets large, this approaches $2$ as desired.\n\n\n27.1-5\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Karan measures her deterministic multithreaded algorithm on $4$, $10$, and $64$ processors of an ideal parallel computer using a greedy scheduler.

You need not partition the array in place. Make your algorithm as parallel as possible. Analyze your algorithm. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ You may need an auxiliary array and may need to make more than one pass over the input elements.)\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that there are $c$ different processors, and the array has length $n$\nand you are going to use its last element as a pivot. Then, look at each chunk\nof size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{c} \\rceil$ of entries before the last element, give one to each processor. Then, each counts the number of elements that are less than the pivot. Then, we compute all the running sums of these values that are returned. This can be done easily by considering all of the subarrays placed along the leaves of a binary tree, and then summing up adjacent pairs. This computation can be done in time $\\lg(\\min\\{c, n\\})$ since it's the log of the number of leaves. From there, we can compute all the running sums for each of the subarrays also in logarithmic time. This is by keeping track of the sum of all more left cousins of each internal node, which is found by adding the left sibling's sum vale to the left cousin value of the parent, with the root's left cousin value initiated to $0$. This also just takes time the depth of the tree, so is $\\lg(\\min\\{c, n\\})$. Once all of these values are computed at the root, it is the index that the subarray's elements less than the pivot should be put. To find the position where the subarray's elements larger than the root should be put, just put it at twice the sum value of the root minus the left cousin value for that subarray. Then, the time taken is just $O(\\frac{n}{c})$. By doing this procedure, the total work is just $O(n)$, and the span is $O(\\lg n)$, and so has parallelization of $O(\\frac{n}{\\lg n})$.

Run partition from problem 27.3-3. As an intermediate step, in that procedure, we compute the number of elements less than the pivot ($T.root.sum$), so keep track of that value after the end of partition. Then, if we have that it is less than $k$, recurse on the subarray that was greater than or equal to the pivot, decreasing the order statistic of the element to be selected by $T.root.sum$. If it is larger than the order statistic of the element to be selected, then leave it unchanged and recurse on the subarray that was formed to be less than the pivot. A lot of the analysis in section 9.2 still applies, except replacing the timer needed for partitioning with the runtime of the algorithm in problem 27.3-3. The work is unchanged from the serial case because when $c = 1$, the algorithm reduces to the serial algorithm for partitioning. For span, the $O(n)$ term in the equation half way down page 218 can be replaced with an $O(\\lg n)$ term.

The function $\\text{P-PARTITION}(A, x)$ is a multithreaded function which partitions $A$ around the input element $x$ and returns the number of elements in $A$ which are less than or equal to $x$. Using a parallel \nfor\n loop, its span is logarithmic in the number of elements in $A$. The work is the same as the serialization, which is $\\Theta(n)$ according to section 9.3.

You need not partition the array in place. Make your algorithm as parallel as possible. Analyze your algorithm. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ You may need an auxiliary array and may need to make more than one pass over the input elements.)   Suppose that there are $c$ different processors, and the array has length $n$\nand you are going to use its last element as a pivot. Then, look at each chunk\nof size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{c} \\rceil$ of entries before the last element, give one to each processor. Then, each counts the number of elements that are less than the pivot. Then, we compute all the running sums of these values that are returned. This can be done easily by considering all of the subarrays placed along the leaves of a binary tree, and then summing up adjacent pairs. This computation can be done in time $\\lg(\\min\\{c, n\\})$ since it's the log of the number of leaves. From there, we can compute all the running sums for each of the subarrays also in logarithmic time. This is by keeping track of the sum of all more left cousins of each internal node, which is found by adding the left sibling's sum vale to the left cousin value of the parent, with the root's left cousin value initiated to $0$. This also just takes time the depth of the tree, so is $\\lg(\\min\\{c, n\\})$. Once all of these values are computed at the root, it is the index that the subarray's elements less than the pivot should be put. To find the position where the subarray's elements larger than the root should be put, just put it at twice the sum value of the root minus the left cousin value for that subarray. Then, the time taken is just $O(\\frac{n}{c})$. By doing this procedure, the total work is just $O(n)$, and the span is $O(\\lg n)$, and so has parallelization of $O(\\frac{n}{\\lg n})$.

Randomly pick a pivot element, swap it with the last element, so that it is in the correct format for running the procedure described in 27.3-3. Run partition from problem 27.3-3. As an intermediate step, in that procedure, we compute the number of elements less than the pivot ($T.root.sum$), so keep track of that value after the end of partition. Then, if we have that it is less than $k$, recurse on the subarray that was greater than or equal to the pivot, decreasing the order statistic of the element to be selected by $T.root.sum$. If it is larger than the order statistic of the element to be selected, then leave it unchanged and recurse on the subarray that was formed to be less than the pivot. A lot of the analysis in section 9.2 still applies, except replacing the timer needed for partitioning with the runtime of the algorithm in problem 27.3-3. The work is unchanged from the serial case because when $c = 1$, the algorithm reduces to the serial algorithm for partitioning. For span, the $O(n)$ term in the equation half way down page 218 can be replaced with an $O(\\lg n)$ term.

For example, when $k = 0$, the last two arguments to $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ are $1$, when $k = 1$, the last two arguments are $2$, and so on. That is, in each call to $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$, its \nfor\n loop iterates once and calculates a single value in the array $C$. When $grain\\text-size = 1$, the \nfor\n loop in $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ iterates $n$ times and each iteration takes $\\Theta(1)$ time, resulting in $\\Theta(n)$ work.\n\n\nAlthough the \nfor\n loop in $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ looks serial, note that each iteration spawns the call to $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ and the procedure waits for all its spawned children at the end of the \nfor\n loop. That is, all loop iterations of $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ execute in parallel. Therefore, one might be tempted to say that the span of $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ is equal to the span of a single call to $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ plus the constant work done by the \ufb01rst three lines in $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$, giving $\\Theta(1)$ span and $\\Theta(n)$ parallelism. This calculation of span and parallelism would be wrong, however, because there are $r$ spawns of $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ in $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$, where $r$ is not a constant. Hence, we must add a $\\Theta(r)$ term to the span of $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ in order to account for the overhead of spawning $r$ calls to $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$.\n\n\nBased on the above discussion, the span of $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ is $\\Theta(r) + \\Theta(grain\\text-size) + \\Theta(1)$. When $grain\\text-size = 1$, we get $r = n$; therefore, $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ has $\\Theta(n)$ span and $\\Theta(1)$ parallelism.\n\n\nc.\n For a general $grain\\text-size$, each iteration of the \nfor\n loop in $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ except for the last results in $grain\\text-size$ iterations of the \nfor\n loop in $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$. In the last iteration of $\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$, the \nfor\n loop in $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ iterates $n \\mod grain\\text-size$ times. Therefore, we can claim that the span of $\\text{ADD-SUBARRAY}$ is \n\n\n$$\\Theta(\\max(grain\\text-size, n \\mod grain\\text-size)) = \\Theta(grain\\text-size).$$\n\n\n$\\text{SUM-ARRAYS}'$ achieves maximum parallelism when its span, given by $\\Theta(r) + \\Theta(grain\\text-size) + \\Theta(1)$, is minimum.

Because one of the recursive calls to $\\text{P-REDUCE}$ is spawned and the procedure does constant work following the recursive calls and in the base case, the span is given by the recurrence $T_\\infty(n) = T_\\infty(n / 2) + \\Theta(1) = \\Theta(\\lg n)$.\n\n\nb.\n The work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-1-AUX}$ dominate the work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-1}$. We can calculate the work of $\\text{P-SCAN-1-AUX}$ by replacing the \nparallel for\n loop with an ordinary \nfor\n loop and noting that in each iteration, the running time of $\\text{P-REDUCE}$ will be equal to $\\Theta(l)$. Since $\\text{P-SCAN-1}$ calls $\\text{P-SCAN-1-AUX}$ with $1$ and $n$ as the last two arguments, the running time of $\\text{P-SCAN-1}$, and hence its work, is $\\Theta(1 + 2 + \\cdots + n) = \\Theta(n^2)$.\n\n\nAs we noted earlier, the \nparallel for\n loop in $\\text{P-SCAN-1-AUX}$ undergoes $n$ iterations; therefore, the span of $\\text{P-SCAN-1-AUX}$ is given by $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ for the recursive splitting of the loop iterations plus the span of the iteration that has maximum span. Among the loop iterations, the call to $\\text{P-REDUCE}$ in the last iteration (when $l = n$) has the maximum span, equal to $\\Theta(\\lg n)$. Thus, $\\text{P-SCAN-1}$ has $\\Theta(\\lg n)$ span and $\\Theta(n^2 / \\lg n)$ parallelism.\n\n\nc.\n In $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$, before the \nparallel for\n loop in lines 7 and 8 executes, the following invariant is satisfied: $y[l] = x[i] \\otimes x[i + 1] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[l]$ for $l = i, i + 1, \\ldots, k$ and $y[l] = x[k + 1] \\otimes x[k + 2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k]$ for $l = k + 1, k + 2, \\ldots, j$. The \nparallel for\n loop need not update $y[i], \\ldots, y[k]$, since they have the correct values after the call to $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}(x, y, i, k)$. For $l = k + 1, k + 2, \\ldots, j$, the \nparallel for\n loop sets \n\n\n\\begin{align}\ny[l] & = y[k] \\otimes y[l] \\\\\n     & = x[i] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k] \\otimes x[k + 1] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[l] \\\\\n     & = x[i] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[l].\n\\end{align}\n\n\nas desired. We can run this loop in parallel because the $l$th iteration depends only on the values of $y[k]$, which is the same in all iterations, and $y[l]$. Therefore, when the call to $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$ from $\\text{P-SCAN-2}$ returns, array $y$ represents the $\\otimes$-prefix computation of array $x$.\n\n\nBecause the work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$ dominate the work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-2}$, we will concentrate on calculating these values for $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$ working on an array of size $n$. The work $PS2A_1(n)$ of $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$ is given by the recurrence $PS2A_1(n) = 2PS2A_1(n / 2) + \\Theta(\\lg n)$, which equals $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ by case 2 of the master theorem. The span $PS2A_\\infty(n)$ of $\\text{P-SCAN-2-AUX}$ is given by the recurrence $PS2A_\\infty(n) = PS2A_\\infty(n / 2) + \\Theta(\\lg n)$, which equals $\\Theta(\\lg^2 n)$ per Exercise 4.6-2. That is, the work, span, and parallelism of $\\text{P-SCAN-2}$ are $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$, $\\Theta(\\lg^2 n)$, and $\\Theta(n / \\lg n)$, respectively.\n\n\nd.\n The missing expression in line 8 of $\\text{P-SCAN-UP}$ is $t[k] \\otimes right$ right. The missing expressions in lines 5 and 6 of $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$ are $v$ and $v \\otimes t[k]$, respectively.\n\n\nAs suggested in the hint, we will prove that the value $v$ passed to $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}(v, x, t, y, i, j)$ satisfies $v = x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[i - 1]$, so that the value $v \\otimes x[i]$ stored into $y[i]$ in the base case of $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$ is correct.\n\n\nIn order to compute the arguments that are passed to $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$, we must first understand what $t[k]$ holds as a result of the call to $\\text{P-SCAN-UP}$. A call to $\\text{P-SCAN-UP}(x, t, i, j)$ returns $x[i] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[j]$; because $t[k]$ stores the return value of $\\text{P-SCAN-UP}(x, t, i, k)$, we can say that $t[k] = x[i] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k]$.\n\n\nThe value $v = x[1]$ when $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}(x[1], x, t, y, 2, n)$ is called from $\\text{P-SCAN-3}$ clearly satisifies $v = x[1] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[i - 1]$. Let us suppose that $v = x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[i - 1]$ in a call of $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}(v, x, t, y, i, j)$. Therefore, $v$ meets the required condition in the first recursive call, with $i$ and $k$ as the last two arguments, in $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$. If we can prove that the value $v \\otimes t[k]$ passed to the second recursive call in $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$ equals $x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k]$, we would have proved the required condition on $v$ for all calls to $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$. Earlier, we proved that $t[k] = x[i] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k]$; therefore,\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nv \\otimes t[k]\n    & = x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[i - 1] \\otimes x[i] \\otimes \\cdots x[k] \\\\\n    & = x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[k].\n\\end{align}\n\n\nThus, the value $v$ passed to $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}(v, x, t, y, i, j)$ satisfies $v = x[1] \\otimes x[2] \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes x[i - 1]$.\n\n\ne.\n Let $PSU_1(n)$ and $PSU_\\infty(n)$ denote the work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-UP}$ and let $PSD_1(n)$ and $PSD_\\infty(n)$ denote the work and span of $\\text{P-SCAN-DOWN}$.

            "text": "Computational science is replete with algorithms that require the entries of an array to be filled in with values that depend on the values of certain already computed neighboring entries, along with other information that does not change over the course of the computation. The pattern of neighboring entries does not change during the computation and is called a \nstencil\n. For example, Section 15.4 presents a stencil algorithm to compute a longest common subsequence, where the value in entry $c[i, j]$ depends only on the values in $c[i - 1, j]$, $c[i, j - 1]$, and $c[i - 1, j - 1]$, as well as the elements $x_i$ and $y_j$ within the two sequences given as inputs. The input sequences are fixed, but the algorithm fills in the two-dimensional array $c$ so that it computes entry $c[i, j]$ after computing all three entries $c[i - 1, j]$, $c[i, j - 1]$, and $c[i - 1, j - 1]$.\n\n\nIn this problem, we examine how to use nested parallelism to multithread a simple stencil calculation on an $n \\times n$ array $A$ in which, of the values in $A$, the value placed into entry $A[i, j]$ depends only on values in $A[i' , j']$, where $i' \\le i$ and $j' \\le j$ (and of course, $i' \\ne i$ or $j' \\ne j$). In other words, the value in an entry depends only on values in entries that are above it and/or to its left, along with static information outside of the array. Furthermore, we assume throughout this problem that once we have filled in the entries upon which $A[i, j]$ depends, we can fill in $A[i, j]$ in $\\Theta(1)$ time (as in the $\\text{LCS-LENGTH}$ procedure of Section 15.4).\n\n\nWe can partition the $n \\times n$ array $A$ into four $n / 2 \\times n / 2$ subarrays as follows:\n\n\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nA_{11} & A_{12} \\\\\nA_{21} & A_{22} \\tag{27.11}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n\nObserve now that we can fill in subarray $A_{11}$ recursively, since it does not depend on the entries of the other three subarrays. Once $A_{11}$ is complete, we can continue to fill in $A_{12}$ and $A_{21}$ recursively in parallel, because although they both depend on $A_{11}$ , they do not depend on each other. Finally, we can fill in $A_{22}$ recursively.\n\n\na.\n Give multithreaded pseudocode that performs this simple stencil calculation using a divide-and-conquer algorithm $\\text{SIMPLE-STENCIL}$ based on the decomposition $\\text{(27.11)}$ and the discussion above. (Don't worry about the details of the base case, which depends on the specific stencil.) Give and solve recurrences for the work and span of this algorithm in terms of $n$. What is the parallelism?\n\n\nb.\n Modify your solution to part (a) to divide an $n \\times n$ array into nine $n / 3 \\times n / 3$ subarrays, again recursing with as much parallelism as possible. Analyze this algorithm. How much more or less parallelism does this algorithm have compared with the algorithm from part (a)?\n\n\nc.\n Generalize your solutions to parts (a) and (b) as follows. Choose an integer $b \\ge 2$. Divide an $n \\times n$ array into $b^2$ subarrays, each of size $n / b \\times n / b$, recursing with as much parallelism as possible. In terms of $n$ and $b$, what are the work, span, and parallelism of your algorithm? Argue that, using this approach, the parallelism must be $o(n)$ for any choice of $b \\ge 2$. ($\\textit{Hint:}$ For this last argument, show that the exponent of $n$ in the parallelism is strictly less than $1$ for any choice of $b \\ge 2$.)\n\n\nd.\n Give pseudocode for a multithreaded algorithm for this simple stencil calculation that achieves $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ parallelism. Argue using notions of work and span that the problem, in fact, has $\\Theta(n)$ inherent parallelism. As it turns out, the divide-and-conquer nature of our multithreaded pseudocode does not let us achieve this maximal parallelism.\n\n\n\n\na.\n In this part of the problem, we will assume that $n$ is an exact power of $2$, so that in a recursive step, when we divide the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ into four $n / 2 \\times n / 2$ matrices, we will be guaranteed that $n / 2$ is an integer, for all $n \\ge 2$. We make this assumption simply to avoid introducing $\\lfloor n / 2 \\rfloor$ and $\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil$ terms in the pseudocode and the analysis that follow.

In general, for $i = 2, 3, 4, 5$, we can calculate group $i$ after completing the computation of group $i - 1$.\n\n\nThe recurrence for the work is\n$$T_1(n) = 9T_1(n / 3) + \\Theta(1) = \\Theta(n^2).$$\n\n\nThe recurrence for the span is \n\n\n$$T_\\infty(n) = 5T_\\infty(n / 3) + \\Theta(1) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_3 5}).$$ \n\n\nTherefore, the parallelism is \n\n\n$$\\Theta(n^{2 - \\log_3 5}) \\approx \\Theta(n^{0.535}).$$\n\n\nc.\n Similar to the previous part, we can solve the $b^2$ subproblems in $2b - 1$ groups:\n\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & b - 2 & b - 1 & b \\\\\n2 & 3 & 4 & \\cdots & b - 1 & b     & b + 1 \\\\\n3 & 4 & 5 & \\cdots & b     & b + 1 & b + 2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\nb - 2 & b - 1 & b     & \\cdots & 2b - 5 & 2b - 4 & 2b - 3 \\\\\nb - 1 & b     & b + 1 & \\cdots & 2b - 4 & 2b - 3 & 2b - 2 \\\\\nb     & b + 1 & b + 2 & \\cdots & 2b - 3 & 2b - 2 & 2b - 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\n\nThe recurrence for the work is\n\n\n$$T_1(n) = b^2 T_1(n / b) + \\Theta(1) = \\Theta(n^2).$$\n\n\nThe recurrence for the span is\n\n\n$$T_\\infty(n) = (2b - 1) T_\\infty(n / b) + \\Theta(1) = \\Theta(n^{\\log_b (2b - 1)}).$$\n\n\nThe parallelism is\n\n\n$$\\Theta(n^{2 - \\log_b (2b - 1)}).$$\n\n\nAs the hint suggests, in order to show that the parallelism must be $o(n)$ for any choice of $b \\ge 2$, we need to show that $2 - \\log_b (2b - 1)$, which is the exponent of $n$ in the parallelism, is strictly less than $1$ for any choice of $b \\ge 2$. Since $b \\ge 2$, we know that $2b - 1 > b$, which implies that $\\log_b (2b - 1) > \\log_b b = 1$. Hence, $2 - \\log_b (2b - 1) < 2 - 1 = 1$.\n\n\nd.\n The idea behind achieving $\\Theta(n / \\lg n)$ parallelism is similar to that presented in the previous part, except without recursive division. We will compute $A[1, 1]$ serially, which will enable us to compute entries $A[1, 2]$ and $A[2, 1]$ in parallel, after which we can compute entries $A[1, 3]$, $A[2, 2]$ and $A[3, 1]$ in parallel, and so on.

Because index $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n$ in the first \nfor\n loop, we require $\\Theta(1 + 2 + \\cdots + n) = \\Theta(n^2)$ work to calculate all entries on the antidiagonal and above it. For each value of index $i$ of the second serial \nfor\n loop, the inner loop iterates $n - i + 1$ times, doing constant work in each iteration. Because index $i$ ranges from $2$ to $n$ in the second \nfor\n loop, we require $\\Theta((n - 1) + (n - 2) + \\cdots + 1) = \\Theta(n^2)$ work to calculate all entries on the antidiagonal and above it.

Therefore, in order to calculate the span of $\\text{P-STENCIL}$, we must add the spans of all the \nparallel for\n loops.

We are given a set $\\{(x_i, y_i): i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ of $n + 1$ point-value pairs, where $x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots < x_n$. We wish to fit a piecewise-cubic curve (spline) $f(x)$ to the points. That is, the curve $f(x)$ is made up of $n$ cubic polynomials $f_i(x) = a_i + b_ix + c_ix^2 + d_ix^3$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1$, where if $x$ falls in the range $x_i \\le x \\le x_{i + 1}$, then the value of the curve is given by $f(x) = f_i(x - x_i)$. The points $x_i$ at which the cubic polynomials are ''pasted'' together are called \nknots\n. For simplicity, we shall assume that $x_i = i$ for $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\nTo ensure continuity of $f(x)$, we require that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\nf(x_i)       & = f_i(0) = y_i, \\\\\nf(x_{i + 1}) & = f_i(1) = y_{i + 1}\n\\end{align}\n\n\nfor $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 1$.

How quickly can we compute the $4n$ coefficients from the point-value pairs and first derivatives?\n\n\nThe question remains of how to choose the first derivatives of $f(x)$ at the knots. One method is to require the second derivatives to be continuous at the knots:\n\n\n$$f''(x_{i + 1}) = f''_i(1) = f''_{i + 1}(0)$$\n\n\nfor $i = 0, 1, \\ldots, n - 2$. At the first and last knots, we assume that $f''(x_0) = f''_0(0) = 0$ and $f''(x_n) = f''_{n - 1}(1) = 0$; these assumptions make $f(x)$ a \nnatural\n cubic spline.\n\n\nb.\n Use the continuity constraints on the second derivative to show that for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n - 1$,\n\n\n$$D_{i - 1} + 4D_i + D_{i + 1} = 3(y_{i + 1} - y_{i - 1}). \\tag{23.21}$$\n\n\nc.\n Show that\n\n\n\\begin{align}\n      2D_0 + D_1 & = 3(y_1 - y_0),       \\tag{28.22} \\\\\nD_{n - 1} + 2D_n & = 3(y_n - y_{n - 1}). \\tag{28.23}\n\\end{align}\n\n\nd.\n Rewrite equations $\\text{(28.21)}$\u2013$\\text{(28.23)}$ as a matrix equation involving the vector $D = \\langle D_0, D_1, \\ldots, D_n \\rangle$ or unknowns.

To choose the subsets efficiently, in the $k$th iteration, we could divide the numbers based on the value of the index's $k$th bit.",
